Amazing Grace

Amazing Grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me

I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see

'Twas grace that taught my heart to Fear and grace my fears relieved

How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers toils and Snares I have already come

'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus Far and grace will lead me home

The Lord has promised good to me
His Word my hope secures

He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures

And when this flesh and heart shall fail
And mortal life shall cease

I shall possess within the veil
a life of joy and peace

When we've been there ten thousand years bright shining as the sun

We've no less days to sing God's praise than when we first begun
