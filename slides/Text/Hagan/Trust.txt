Trust

Trust in the Lord with all your heart
lean not on your own understanding

In all your ways acknowledge Him
And He will make your paths straight

Don’t worry about tomorrow
He’s got it under control

Just trust in the Lord with all your heart
And He will carry you through

Trust in the Lord with all your heart
Lean not on your own understanding

In all your ways acknowledge Him
And He will make your paths straight

Don’t worry about tomorrow,
He’s got it under control.
Just trust in the Lord with all your heart
and He will carry you through.

Don’t worry about tomorrow,
He’s got it under control.
Just trust in the Lord with all your heart

and He will carry you through. (x3)‏
