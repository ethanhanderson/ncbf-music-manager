Holy Holy Holy

Holy holy holy
Lord God almighty

Early in the morning our 
Song shall rise to thee

Holy holy holy
Merciful and mighty

God in three persons
Blessed Trinity

Holy holy holy 
All the saints adore thee

Casting down their golden crowns
Around the glassy sea

Cherubim and seraphim 
Falling down before thee

Who wert and art
And evermore shalt be

Holy holy holy
Though the darkness hide thee

Though the eye of sinful man
Thy glory may not see

Only thou art Holy
There is none beside thee

Perfect in power 
In love and purity

Holy holy holy
Lord God almighty

All thy works shall praise thy name
In earth and sky and sea

Holy holy holy
Merciful and mighty

God in three persons
Blessed Trinity
