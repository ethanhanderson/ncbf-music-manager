Title: Come, Christians, Join to Sing

Come, Christians, Join to Sing

Come, Christians, join to sing 
alleluia! Amen!

Loud praise to Christ our King; 
alleluia! Amen!

Let all, with heart and voice, 
before His throne rejoice;

Praise is His gracious choice. 
Alleluia! Amen!

Come, lift your hearts on high, 
alleluia! Amen!

Let praises fill the sky; 
alleluia! Amen!

He is our Guide and Friend; 
to us He’ll condescend;

His love shall never end. 
Alleluia! Amen!

Praise yet our Christ again, 
alleluia! Amen!

Life shall not end the strain; 
alleluia! Amen!

On heaven’s blissful shore, His 
goodness we’ll adore,

Singing forevermore, 
“Alleluia! Amen!”
