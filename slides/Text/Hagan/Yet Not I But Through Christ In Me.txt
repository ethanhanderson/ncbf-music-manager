Title: Yet Not I But Through Christ In Me.pro

Yet Not I But Through
Christ In Me

What gift of grace is
Jesus my redeemer

There is no more for
Heaven now to give

He is my joy my righteousness 
And freedom

My steadfast love
My deep and boundless peace

To this I hold
My hope is only Jesus

For my life is
Wholly bound to his

Oh how strange and divine
 I can sing all is mine

Yet not I but through
Christ in me

The night is dark but
I am not forsaken

For by my side the
Savior He will stay

I labor on in
Weakness and rejoicing

For in my need
His power is displayed

To this I hold
My Shepherd will defend me

Through the deepest valley
He will lead

Oh the night has been won
And I shall overcome

Yet not I but through
Christ in me

No fate I dread
I know I am forgiven

The future sure the price it
Has been paid

For Jesus bled and suffered
For my pardon

And He was raised to
Overthrow the grave

To this I hold
My sin has been defeated

Jesus now and ever
Is my plea

Oh the chains are released
I can sing I am free

Yet not I but through
Christ in me

With every breath
I long to follow Jesus

For He has said that
He will bring me home

And day by day
I know He will renew me

Until I stand with joy
Before the throne

To this I hold
My hope is only Jesus

All the glory
Evermore to Him

When the race is complete
Still my lips shall repeat

Yet not I but through
Christ in me

To this I hold
My hope is only Jesus

All the glory
Evermore to Him

When the race is complete
Still my lips shall repeat

Yet not I but through
Christ in me

When the race is complete
Still my lips shall repeat

Yet not I but through
Christ in me

Yet not I but through
Christ in me

Yet not I but through
Christ in me
