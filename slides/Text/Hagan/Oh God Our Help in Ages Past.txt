   Oh God Our
Help in Ages Past

Oh God our help in ages past
Our hope for years to come

Our shelter from the stormy blast
And our eternal home

Beneath the shadow of Thy throne
Thy saints have dwelt secure

Sufficient is Thine arm alone
And our defense is sure

Before the hills in order stood
Or Earth received her frame

From everlasting Thou art God
To endless years the same

A thousand ages in Thy sight are
Like an evening gone

Short as the watch that ends the night
Before the rising sun   

Oh God our help in ages past
Our hope for years to come

Be thou our guard while troubles last
And our eternal home.
