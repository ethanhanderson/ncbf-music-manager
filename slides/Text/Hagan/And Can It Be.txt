And Can It Be

And can it be that I should gain An interest in the Savior’s blood

Died He for me who caused His pain
For me who Him to death pursued

Amazing love how can it be That Thou my God shouldst die for me

Amazing love how can it be That Thou my God shouldst die for me

Amazing love how can it be That Thou my God shouldst die for me

He left His Father’s throne above
So free so infinite His grace

Emptied Himself of all but love
And bled for all His chosen race

’Tis mercy all immense and free
For oh my God it found out me

Long my imprisoned spirit lay Fast bound in sin and nature’s night

Thine eye diffused a quickening ray
I woke the dungeon flamed with light

My chains fell off my heart was free
I rose went forth and followed Thee

No condemnation now I dread
Jesus and all in Him is mine

Alive in Him my living HeadAnd clothed in righteousness divine

Bold I approach the eternal throne
And claim the crown through 
Christ my own
