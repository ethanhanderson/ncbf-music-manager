Man of Sorrows

Man of sorrows what a name
For the Son of God who came

Ruined sinners to reclaim
Hallelujah what a Savior

Bearing shame and scoffing rude
In my place condemned he stood

Sealed my pardon with his blood
Hallelujah what a Savior

Guilty vile and helpless me
Spotless Lamb of God was he

Full atonement can it be
Hallelujah what a Savior

Lifted up was He to die
"It is finished" was his cry

Now in heaven exalted high
Hallelujah what a Savior

When he comes our glorious King
All his ransomed home to bring

Then anew this song we'll sing
Hallelujah what a Savior
