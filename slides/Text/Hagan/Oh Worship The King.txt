Title: Oh Worship The King.pro

Oh Worship The King

Oh worship the King
All glorious above 

And gratefully sing
His power and His love

Our shield and defender
The Ancient of Days

Pavilioned in splendor
And girded with praise

Oh tell of His might
Oh sing of His grace

Whose robe is the light
Whose canopy space

Whose chariots of wrath
The deep thunder clouds form

And dark is His path
On the wings of the storm

Thy bountiful care
What tongue can recite

It breathes in the air
It shines in the light

It streams from the hills
It descends to the plain

And sweetly distills
In the dew and the rain

   Frail children of dust
And feeble as frail

In Thee do we trust
Nor find Thee to fail

Thy mercies how tender
How firm to the end

Our maker defender 
redeemer and friend
