Title: The Nails in Your Hands.pro

The Nails in Your Hands

The nails in Your hands
The nails in Your feet

They tell me how much
You love me

The thorns in Your brow
They tell me how

You bore so much pain
To love me

And when the heavens pass away
All your scars will still remain

And forever they will say how much
You love me

And I want to say

Forever my love
Forever my heart

Forever my life is Yours
