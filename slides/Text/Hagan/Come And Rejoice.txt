Title: Come And Rejoice.pro

Come and Rejoice

Come with rejoicing
The Father is calling

Those who would worship 
In spirit and truth

Come with your singing 
Come with thanksgiving

Jesus our Savior has made
All things new

Come and rejoice oh holy people
Come and sing praises to him

Come and bow down
Worship before him

Jesus the King of all kings
Jesus the King of all kings

The Lord of creation is
Full of compassion

Seated in splendor
Adorned with all grace

Majestic and glorious Reigning victorious

Now and forever
Enthroned on our praise

He gave us his spirit
He summons his children

Calling a priesthood to
Go in his name

To show forth his power
To this generation

To worship before him
A kingdom of praise
