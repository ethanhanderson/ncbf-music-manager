In Christ Alone

In Christ alone my
Hope is found

He is my light my
Strength my song

This cornerstone this
Solid ground

Firm through the fiercest
Drought and storm

What heights of love what
Depths of peace

When fear are stilled when 
Strivings cease

My Comforter
My all in all

Here in the love of
Christ I stand

In Christ alone who
Took on flesh

Fullness of God in
Helpless babe

This gift of love
And rightousness

Scorned by the ones
He came to save

Till on that cross
As Jesus died

The wrath of God
Was satisfied

For every sin on
Him was laid

Here in the death
Of Christ I live

There in the ground
His body lay

Light of the world
By darkness slain

The bursting forth
In glorious day

Up from the grave
He rose again

And as He stands
In Victory

Sin’s curse has lost
Its grip on me

For I am His and
He is mine

Bought with the precious
Blood of Christ

No guilt in life
No fear in death

This is the power 
Of Christ in me

From life’s first cry
To final breath

Jesus commands
My destiny

No power of hell
No scheme of man

Can ever pluck me
From His hand

Till He returns or
Calls me home

Here in the power of
Christ I’ll stand
