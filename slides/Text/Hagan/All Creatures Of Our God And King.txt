All Creatures Of
Our God And King

All creatures of our God and king
Lift up your voice and with us sing

Alleluia alleluia

Thou burning sun with golden beam
Thou silver moon with softer gleam

Oh praise him oh praise him
Alleluia alleluia alleluia

Thou rushing wind that art so strong
Ye clouds that sail in heaven along

Oh praise Him alleluia

Thou rising morn in praise rejoice
Ye lights of evening find a voice

Thou flowing water pure and clear
Make music for thy Lord to hear

Alleluia alleluia

Thou fire so masterful and bright
That givest man both warmth and light

And all ye men of tender heart
Forgiving others take your part

Oh sing ye alleluia

Ye who long pain and sorrow bear
Praise God and on him cast your care

Let all things their Creator bless
And worship Him in humbleness

Oh praise Him alleluia

Praise praise the Father praise the Son
And praise the Spirit Three in One
