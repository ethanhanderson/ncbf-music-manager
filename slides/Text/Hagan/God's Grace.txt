Title: God's Grace

God's Grace

You children of God by
Faith in his Son

Redeemed by his blood and with
Him made one

This union with wonder and
Rapture be seen

Which nothing shall sunder
Without or within

This pardon this peace which
None can destroy

This treasure of grace and
Heavenly joy

The worthless may crave it
It always comes free

The vilest may have it
It was given to me

God's grace has paid for
All my sin

God's grace
Though it cost so much to him

God's grace has freed
Even my will

God's grace
To the end sustains me still

It's not for good deeds
Good tempers nor frames

From grace it proceeds and 
All is the Lamb's

No goodness no fitness expects
He from us

This I can well witness for
None could be worse

Sick sinner
Expect no balm but Christ's blood

Your own works reject
The bad and the good

None ever regret it that
On him rely

Though guilty as
Saul or Jonah or I
