Title: You Are My King

You Are My King

I’m forgiven because you were forsaken
I’m accepted you were condemned

I’m alive and well your spirit is within me
Because you died and rose again

Amazing love how can it be
That you my King would die for me

Amazing love I know it’s true
It’s my joy to honor you 

In all I do to honor you

You are my king
Jesus you are my king
