Title: Praise The Lord Almighty.pro

Praise to the Lord
The Almighty

Praise to the Lord the almighty
The King of creation

Oh my soul praise him 
For he is thy health and salvation

All ye who hear now to
His temple draw near

Join me in
Glad adoration

Praise to the Lord who over
All things so wondrously reigneth

Shelters thee under his wings
Yea so gently sustaineth

Hast thou not seen
How all your longings

Have been granted
In what He ordaineth

Praise to the Lord who doth prosper
Thy work and defend thee

Surely his goodness and mercy
Here daily attend thee

Ponder anew what the almighty can do
If with his love He befriend thee

Praise to the Lord
Oh let all that is in me adore him

All that hath life and breath 
Come now with praises before him

Let the Amen sound from
His people again

Gladly for yea
We adore him
