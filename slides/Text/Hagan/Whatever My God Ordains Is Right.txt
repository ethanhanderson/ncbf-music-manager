Whatever My God Ordains Is Right

Whate'er my God ordains is right
Holy His will abideth

I will be still whate'er He does
And follow where He guideth

He is my God though dark my road
He holds me that I shall not fall
Wherefore to Him I leave it all

Whate'er my God ordains is right
He never will deceive me

He leads me by the proper path
I know He will not leave me

I take content what He hath sent
His hand can turn my griefs away
And patiently I wait His day

Whate'er my God ordains is right
Though now this cup in drinking

May bitter seem to my faint heart
I take it all unshrinking

My God is true each morn anew
Sweet comfort yet shall fill my heart
And pain and sorrow shall depart

Whate'er my God ordains is right
Here shall my stand be taken

Though sorrow need
Or death be mine
Yet I am not forsaken

My Father’s care is round me there
He holds me that I shall not fall
And so to Him I leave it all

He holds me that I shall not fall
And so to Him I leave it all
