Immortal Invisible
God Only Wise

Immortal invisible God only wise
In light inaccessible hid from our eyes

Most blessed most glorious
The Ancient of Days

Almighty victorious
Thy great name we praise

Unresting unhasting
And silent as light

Nor wanting nor wasting
Thou rulest in might

Thy justice like mountains
High soaring above

Thy clouds which are fountains 
Of goodness and love

To all life Thou givest
To both great and small

In all life Thou livest
The true life of all

We blossom and flourish
As leaves on the tree

And wither and perish
But naught changeth Thee

Great Father of glory
Pure Father of light

Thine angels adore
Thee all veiling their sight

All praise we would render
Oh help us to see

Tis only the splendor of light
Hideth Thee
