Title: You Are My All In All

You Are My All in All

You are my strength
When I am weak

You are the treasure
That I seek

You are my all in all
Seeking You as a precious jewel

Lord to give up I'd be a fool
You are my all in all

Jesus Lamb of God
Worthy is Your name

Jesus Lamb of God
Worthy is Your name

Taking my sin
My cross my shame

Rising again I praise Your name
You are my all in all

When I fall down You pick me up
When I am dry You fill my cup

You are my all in all

When the world tries to
Draw me in

You are my path
Away from sin

You are my all in all
Dying to self is how I live

All that I am to You I give
You are my all in all
