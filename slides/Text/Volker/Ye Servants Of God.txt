Ye Servants Of God

Ye servants of God
Your Master proclaim

And publish abroad
His wonderful Name

The name all victorious
Of Jesus extol

His kingdom is glorious
He rules over all

God ruleth on high
Almighty to save

And still He is nigh
His presence we have

The great congregation
His triumph shall sing

Ascribing salvation to
Jesus our King!

Salvation to God
Who sits on the throne!

Let all cry aloud
And honor the Son

The praises of Jesus
The angels proclaim

Fall down on their faces
And worship the Lamb

Then let us adore
And give Him His right

All glory and power 
All wisdom and might

All honor and blessing
With angels above

And thanks never ceasing
And infinite love
