Title: For Our Frame He Well Remembers.pro

For Our Frame
He Well Remembers

For our frame He well remembers
That we’re merely dust He knows

As for man like grass his days are
As the meadow’s flower He grows

When the wind has blown upon it
In a moment it is gone

In the place where once it flourished
It will nevermore be known

But the Lord’s great lovingkindness
On all those who fear His name

From eternity continues
To eternity the same

But His righteousness continues
To their children and their seed

To all those who keep His covenant
And His laws recall and heed
