Title: Let All Mortal Flesh Keep Silent.pro

Let All Mortal
Flesh Keep Silence

Let all mortal flesh keep silence
And with fear and trembling stand

Ponder nothing earthly minded
For with blessing in his hand

Christ our God to earth descendeth
Our full homage to demand

King of kings yet born of Mary
As of old on earth he stood

Lord of lords in human vesture
In the body and the blood

He will give to all the faithful
His own self for heavenly food

Rank on rank the host of heaven
Spreads its vanguard on the way

As the light of light descendeth
From the realm of endless day

That the powers of hell may vanish
As the darkness clears away

At his feet the six winged seraph
Cherubim with sleepless eye

Veil their faces to the presence
As with ceaseless voice they cry

Alleluia alleluia
Alleluia Lord most high!
