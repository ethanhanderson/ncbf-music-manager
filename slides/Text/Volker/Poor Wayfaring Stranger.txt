Poor Wayfaring
Stranger

I am a poor
Wayfaring stranger

Wandering through
This world of woe

There is no sickness
Toil or danger

In that bright world
To which I go

I’m going there to
Meet my Savior

I’m going there
To see my Lord

I’m only going
Over Jordan

I’m only going
Over home

 I know my sins
Are all forgiven

My hopes are stayed
On things above

I’m going away
To yon bright heaven

Where all is joy and peace
And love

I’m going there to
Meet my Savior

I’m going there
To see my Lord

I’m only going
Over Jordan

I’m only going
Over home

I know dark clouds
 Will gather round me

I know my way is
Rough and steep

But beauteous fields
Lie just before me

Where souls redeemed
Their vigil keep

I’m going there to
Meet my Savior

I’m going there to
See my Lord

I’m only going
Over Jordan

I’m only going
Over home

 I want to sing
Salvation’s story

I’m going with
That blood washed band

I want to wear a
Crown of glory

When I get home
To that bright land
