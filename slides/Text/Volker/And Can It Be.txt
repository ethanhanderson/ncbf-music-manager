And Can It Be

And can it be
That I should gain

An interest in
The Savior’s blood?

Died he for me
Who caused His pain?

For me who Him
To death pursued?

Amazing love!
How can it be

That Thou my God
Shouldst die for me?

Amazing love!
How can it be

That Thou my God
Shouldst die for me?

He left His
Father’s throne above

So free so
Infinite His grace!

Emptied Himself of
All but love

And bled for
Adam’s helpless race!

Tis mercy all
Immense and free

For oh my God
It found out me

Tis mercy all
Immense and free

For oh my God
It found out me

Long my 
Imprisoned spirit lay

Fast bound in sin
And nature’s night

Thine eye diffused
A quickening ray

I woke the dungeon
Flamed with light!

My chains fell off
My heart was free

I rose went forth
And followed Thee

My chains fell off
My heart was free

I rose went forth
And followed Thee

No condemnation
Now I dread

Jesus and all 
In Him is mine!

Alive in Him
My living Head

And clothed in
Righteousness divine

Bold I approach
The eternal throne

And claim the crown
Through Christ my own

Bold I approach
The eternal throne

And claim the crown
Through Christ my own
