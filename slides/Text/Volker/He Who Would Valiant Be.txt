Title: He Who Would Valiant Be.pro

He Who Would
Valiant Be

He who would valiant be
Against all disaster

Let him in constancy
Follow the master

There’s no discouragement
Shall make him once relent

His first avowed intent
To be a pilgrim

Who so beset him round
With dismal stories

Do but themselves confound
His strength the more is

No foes shall stay his might
Though he with giants fight

He will make good his right
To be a pilgrim

Since Lord Thou does defend
Us with Thy Spirit

We know we at the end
Shall life inherit

Then fancies flee away!
I’ll fear not what men say

I’ll labor night and day
To be a pilgrim
