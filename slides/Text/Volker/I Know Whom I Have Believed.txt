Title: I Know Whom I Have Believed.pro

I Know Whom
I Have Believed

I know not why God’s wondrous grace
To me He hath made known

Nor why unworthy Christ in love
Redeemed me for his own

But I know whom I have believed
And am persuaded that He is able

To keep that which I’ve committed
Unto Him against that day

I know not how this saving faith
To me He did impart

Nor how believing in His word
wrought peace within my heart

I know not how the Spirit moves
Convincing men of sin

Revealing Jesus through the word
creating faith in Him

But I know whom I have believed
And am persuaded that He is able

To keep that which I’ve committed
Unto Him against that day

I know not what of good or ill
May be reserved for me

Of weary ways or golden days
Before His face I see

I know not when my Lord may come
At night or noonday fair

Nor if I’ll walk the vale with Him
or meet Him in the air

But I know whom I have believed
And am persuaded that He is able

To keep that which I’ve committed
Unto Him against that day
