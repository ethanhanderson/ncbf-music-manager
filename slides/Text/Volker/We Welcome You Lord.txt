We Welcome
You Lord

We welcome you Lord
To walk among your own

To heal broken hearts
To fully worship you

We give thanks for your son
For now we know forgiveness

Cleanse us within 
To share your holiness

Men

Let not the wise

Women

Boast in their wisdom

Men

Let not the strong

Women

Boast in their might

Men

Let not the rich

Women

Boast in their riches

But we shall boast
In knowing you!
