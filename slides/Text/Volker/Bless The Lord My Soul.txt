Bless The Lord
My Soul

Bless the Lord my soul
My whole heart

Ever bless
His holy name

Bless the Lord my
Soul forget not

All His blessings
To proclaim

He forgives all
Your transgressions

Your diseases
All He heals

He redeems you
From destruction

And with you
He kindly deals

He with love and
Mercy crowns you

Satisfied your
Years with good

So that you will
Like the eagle

With youth’s vigor
Be renewed

He shall intervene
With justice

For all those who
Are oppressed

For their sake the
Lord takes action

Governing in
Righteousness
