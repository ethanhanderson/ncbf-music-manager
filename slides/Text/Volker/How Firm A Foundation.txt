How Firm
A Foundation

 How firm a foundation
Ye saints of the Lord

Is laid for your faith 
In His excellent Word!

What more can He say
Than to thee He hath said

To thee who for refuge 
To Jesus hath fled?

Fear not I am with thee
Oh be not dismayed

For I am thy God
And will still give thee aid

I’ll strengthen thee help thee
And cause thee to stand

Upheld by My righteous
Omnipotent hand

When through the deep waters
I call thee to go

The rivers of sorrow 
Shall not overflow

For I will be with thee
Thy troubles to bless

And sanctify to thee
Thy deepest distress

The soul that on Jesus 
Has leaned for repose

I will not I will not
Desert to his foes

That soul though all hell
Should endeavor to shake

I’ll never no never
No never forsake
