Shepherds Rejoice

Shepherds rejoice lift up your eyes
And send your fears away

News from the regions of the skies,
Salvation’s born today

Jesus the God whom angles fear
Comes down to dwell with you

Today He makes His entrance here
But not as monarchs do

No gold nor purple swaddling bands
Nor royal shining things

A manger for His cradle stands
And holds the king of kings

Go shepherds where the infant lies
And see His humble throne

With tears of joy in all your eyes
Go shepherds kiss the Son

Thus Gabriel sang and straight around
The heavenly armies throng

They tune their harps to lofty sound
And thus conclude the song

Glory to God that reigns above!
Let peace surround the earth!

Mortals shall know their Maker’s love
At their Redeemer’s birth

Lord and shall angels have their songs
And men no tunes to raise?

O may we loose our useless tongues
When they forget to praise

Glory to God who reigns above
Who pitied us forlorn

We join to sing our Maker’s love
For there’s a Savior born
