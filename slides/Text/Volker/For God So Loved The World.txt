For God So
Loved The World

For God so loved the world
That he gave His only begotten son

That whosoever believes in Him
Should not perish but

Have life everlasting
Have life everlasting

Have life everlasting
Have life everlasting

For God so loved the world
That he gave His only begotten son

For God did not send His son
Into the world to bring condemnation

But rather that through receiving Him
Men might find true salvation and

For God so loved the world
That he gave His only begotten son

He came into the world
And He dwelt among His own

But His own they
Would not receive Him

But power to become
The sons of God

He gave to all who
Believe Him He

Gave life everlasting
Gave life everlasting

His life everlasting
His life everlasting

For God so loved the world
That he gave His only begotten son
