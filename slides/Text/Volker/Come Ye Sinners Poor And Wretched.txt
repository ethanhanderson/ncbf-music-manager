Title: Come Ye Sinners Poor And Wretched.pro

Come Ye Sinners
Poor And Needy

Come ye sinners poor and wretched
Weak and wounded sick and sore

Jesus ready stands to save you
Full of pity joined with power

He is able He is able
He is willing doubt no more

He is able He is able
He is willing doubt no more

Come ye needy come and welcome
God’s free bounty glorify

True belief and true repentance
Every grace that brings us nigh

Without money without money
Come to Jesus Christ and buy

Without money, without money
Come to Jesus Christ and buy

Come ye weary heavy laden
Bruised and broken by the fall

If you tarry til you’re better
You will never come at all

Not the righteous not the righteous
Sinners Jesus came to call

Not the righteous not the righteous
Sinners Jesus came to call

Lo the incarnate God ascended
Pleads the merit of His blood

Venture on Him venture wholly
Let no other trust intrude

None but Jesus none but Jesus
Can do helpless sinners good

None but Jesus none but Jesus
Can do helpless sinners good

Amen!
