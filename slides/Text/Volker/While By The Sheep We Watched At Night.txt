While By The Sheep
We Watched At Night

While by the sheep 
We watch at night

Glad tidings brought 
An angel bright

How great our joy!
Great our joy!

Joy joy joy!
Joy joy joy!

Praise we the Lord
In heaven on high!

Praise we the Lord
In heaven on high

There shall be born
So he did say

In Bethlehem
A child today

How great our joy!
Great our joy!

Joy joy joy!
Joy joy joy!

Praise we the Lord
In heaven on high!

Praise we the Lord
In heaven on high

There shall the child
Lie in a stall

This child who shall
Redeem us all

How great our joy!
Great our joy!

Joy joy joy!
Joy joy joy!

Praise we the Lord
In heaven on high!

Praise we the Lord
In heaven on high

This gift of God
We’ll cherish well

That ever joy
Our heart shall fill

How great our joy!
Great our joy!

Joy joy joy!
Joy joy joy

Praise we the Lord
In heaven on high!

Praise we the Lord
In heaven on high
