Title: At The Name Of Jesus.pro

At The Name
Of Jesus

At the name of Jesus 
Every knee shall bow

Every tongue confess Him,
King of Glory now

Tis the Father’s pleasure 
we should call Him Lord

Who from the beginning 
Was the mighty word

Humbled for a season
To receive a name

From the lips of sinners
Unto whom He came

Faithfully He bore it
Spotless to the last

Brought it back victorious 
When from death He passed

Bore it up triumphant
With its human light

Through all ranks of creatures
To the central height

To the throne of Godhead
To the Father’s breast

Filled it with the glory 
Of that perfect rest

Name Him Christians name Him
With love strong as death

Name with awe and wonder
And with bated breath

He is God the Savior
He is Christ the Lord

Ever to be worshiped
Trusted and adored

In your hearts enthone Him
There let Him subdue

All that is not holy
All that is not true

Crown Him at your captain
In temptation’s hour

Let His will enfold you
In its light and power

Christians this Lord Jesus
Shall return again

With His Father’s glory
Over the earth to reign

For all wreaths of empire
Meet upon His brow

And our hearts confess Him
King of glory now
