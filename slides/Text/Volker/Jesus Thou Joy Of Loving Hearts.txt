Jesus Thou Joy
Of Loving Hearts

Jesus thou joy of loving hearts
Thou fount of life Thou light of men

From the best bliss that earth imparts
We turn unfilled to Thee again

Thy truth unchanged hath ever stood
Thou savest those that on Thee call

To them that seek Thee Thou are good
To them that find Thee all in all

We taste Thee oh Thou living bread
And long to feast upon Thee still

We drink of Thee the fountain head
And thirst our souls from Thee to fill

Our restless spirits yearn for Thee
Wherever our changeful lot is cast

Glad when Thy gracious smile we see
Blest when our faith can hold Thee fast

Oh Jesus ever with us stay
Make all our moments calm and bright

Chase the dark night of sin away
Shed over the world Thy holy light
