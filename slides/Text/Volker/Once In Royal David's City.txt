Title: Once In Royal David's City.pro

Once In Royal
David’s City

Once in royal
David’s city

Stood a lowly
Cattle shed

Where a mother
Laid her baby

In a manger
For his bed

Mary was that
Mother mild

Jesus Christ
Her little child

He came down to 
Earth from heaven

Who is God
And Lord of all

And his shelter
Was a stable

And his cradle
Was a stall

With the poor
And mean and lowly

Lived on earth
Our Savior holy

And through all 
His wondrous childhood

He would honor
And obey

Love and watch
The lowly maiden

In whose gentle
Arms he lay

Christian children
All must be

Mild obedient
Good as He

And our eyes at 
Last shall see him

Through his own 
Redeeming love

For that child 
So dear and gentle

Is our Lord in
Heaven above

And he leads 
His children on

To the place 
Where he is gone

Not in that poor
Lowly stable

With the oxen
Standing by

We shall see him
But in heaven

Set at God’s right
Hand on high

When like stars 
His children crowned

All in white shall
Wait around
