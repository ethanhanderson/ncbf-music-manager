Title: I Heard The Voice Of Jesus Say.pro

I Heard The Voice
Of Jesus Say

I heard the voice of Jesus say
Come unto Me and rest

Lay down thou weary one lay down
Thy head upon my breast

I came to Jesus as I was
Weary and worn and sad

I found in Him a resting place
And He has made me glad

I heard the voice of Jesus say
Behold I freely give

The living water thirsty one
Stoop down and drink and live

I came to Jesus and I drank
Of that life giving stream

My thirst was quenched
My soul revived

And now I live in Him

I heard the voice of Jesus say
I am this dark world’s light

Look unto Me thy morn shall rise
And all thy day be bright

I looked to Jesus and I found
In Him my star my sun

And in that light of life I’ll walk
Till traveling days are done
