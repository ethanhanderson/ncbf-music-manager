Title: If Thou But Trust In God To Guide Thee.pro

If Thou But Trust In
God To Guide Thee

If thou but trust in
God to guide thee

And hope in him
Through all thy ways

He’ll give thee strength
Whatever betide thee

And bear thee through
The evil days

Who trusts in
God’s unchanging love

Builds on the rock that
Naught can move

What can these anxious
Cares avail thee

These never ceasing
Moans and sighs?

What can it help if
Thou bewail thee

Over each dark
Moment as it flies?

Our cross and trials
Do but press

The heavier for
Our bitterness

Only be still and
Wait his leisure

In cheerful hope
With heart content

To take whatever thy
Father’s pleasure

And all discerning
Love hath sent

Nor doubt our inmost
Wants are known

To him who chose
Us for his own

All are alike before
The Highest

Tis easy to our
God we know

To raise thee up though
Low thou liest

To make the rich
Man poor and low

True wonders still by
Him are wrought

Who setteth up and
Brings to naught.

Sing pray and keep
His ways unswerving

So do thine own
Part faithfully

And trust his Word
Though undeserving

Thou yet shalt find
It true for thee

God never yet
Forsook at need

The soul that
Trusted him indeed
