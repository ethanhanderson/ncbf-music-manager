Only In God Is
My Soul At Rest

Only in God is my soul at rest
In Him comes my salvation

He only is my rock
My strength and my salvation

My stronghold my savior
I shall not be afraid at all

My stronghold my savior
I shall not be moved

Only in God is found safety
When enemies pursue me

Only in God is found glory
I am found meek and found lowly

My stronghold my Savior
I shall not be afraid at all

My stronghold my Savior
I shall not be moved

Only in God is my soul at rest
In Him comes my salvation
