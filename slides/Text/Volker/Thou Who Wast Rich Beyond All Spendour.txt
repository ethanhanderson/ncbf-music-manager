Title: Thou Who Wast Rich Beyond All Spendour.pro

Thou Who Wast Rich
Beyond All Splendour

Thou who wast rich
Beyond all splendour

All for love’s sake
Becamest poor

Thrones for a manger
Didst surrender

Sapphire paved courts
For stable floor

Thou who wast rich
Beyond all splendour

All for love’s sake
Becamest poor

Thou who art God
Beyond all praising

All for love’s sake
Becamest man

Stooping so low
But sinners raising

Heavenwards by
Thine eternal plan

Thou who art God
Beyond all praising

All for love’s sake
Becamest man

Thou who art love
Beyond all telling

Saviour and King
We worship thee

Emmanuel within
Us dwelling

Make us what thou
Wouldst have us be

Thou who art love
Beyond all telling

Saviour and king
We worship thee
