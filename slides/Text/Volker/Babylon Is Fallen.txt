Babylon Is Fallen

Hail the day so long expected
Hail the day of full release

Zion’s walls are now erected
And her watchmen publish peace

Through our Shiloh’s wide dominion
Hear the trumpets loudly roar

Babylon is fallen is fallen is fallen
Babylon is fallen to rise no more

Babylon is fallen is fallen is fallen
Babylon is fallen to rise no more

All her merchants stand with wonder
What is this that comes to pass

Murmuring like a distant thunder
Crying oh alas alas

Swell the sound ye kings and nobles
Priests and people rich and poor

Blow the trumpets from Mount Zion
Christ shall come the second time

Ruling with a rod of iron
All who now as foes combine

Babel’s garments we’ve rejected 
And our fellowship is over
