To God Be
The Glory

To God be the glory
Great things He hath done!

So loved He the world that
He gave us His Son

Who yielded His life
An atonement for sin

And opened the Life gate
That all may go in

Praise the Lord praise the Lord
Let the earth hear His voice!

Praise the Lord praise the Lord
Let the people rejoice!

O come to the Father
Through Jesus the Son

And give Him the glory
Great things He hath done!

Oh perfect redemption
The purchase of blood!

To every believer
The promise of God

The vilest offender
Who truly believes

That moment from Jesus
A pardon receives

Praise the Lord praise the Lord
Let the earth hear His voice!

Praise the Lord praise the Lord
Let the people rejoice!

O come to the Father
Through Jesus the Son

And give Him the glory
Great things He hath done!

Great things He hath taught us,
Great things He hath done

And great our rejoicing
Through Jesus the Son

But purer and higher
And greater will be

Our wonder our transport
When Jesus we see

Praise the Lord praise the Lord
Let the earth hear His voice!

Praise the Lord praise the Lord
Let the people rejoice!

Oh come to the Father
Through Jesus the Son

And give Him the glory
Great things He hath done!

Praise the Lord praise the Lord
Let the earth hear His voice!

Praise the Lord praise the Lord
Let the people rejoice!

Oh come to the Father
Through Jesus the Son

And give Him the glory
Great things He hath done!

To God be the glory
Great things He hath done!

So loved He the world that
He gave us His Son
