Angels From The
Realms Of Glory

Angels from the realms of glory
Wing your flight over all the earth

Ye who sang creation’s story
Now proclaim Messiah’s birth

Come and worship
Come and worship

Worship Christ
The newborn king

Shepherds in the fields abiding
Watching over your flocks by night

God with man is now residing
Yonder shines the infant light

Come and worship
Come and worship

Worship Christ
The newborn king

Sages leave your contemplations
Brighter visions beam afar

Seek the great desire of nations
Ye have seen his natal star

Come and worship
Come and worship

Worship Christ
The newborn king

Saints before the altar bending
Watching long in hope and fear

Suddenly the Lord descending
In His temple shall appear

Come and worship
Come and worship

Worship Christ
The newborn King

Though an infant now we view Him
He will share His Father’s throne

Gather all the nations to Him
Every knee shall then bow down
