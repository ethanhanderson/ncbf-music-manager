Title: Lift Up Your Head Ye Mighty Gates.pro

Lift Up Your Head
Ye Mighty Gates

Lift up your heads
Ye mighty gates!

Behold the King
Of glory waits

The King of kings
Is drawing near

The Savior of the
World is here

A helper just He
Comes to thee

His chariot
Is humility

His kingly crown
Is holiness

His scepter
Pity in distress

Oh blest the land
The city blest

Where Christ the
Ruler is confessed!

Oh happy hearts
And happy homes

To whom this King
In triumph comes!

Fling wide the portals
Of your heart

Make it a temple
Set apart

From earthly use
For heavens employ

Adorned with prayer
And love and joy

Redeemer come
I open wide

My heart to thee
Here Lord abide!

Let me thy inner
Presence feel

Thy grace and love
In me revealed.

So come my
Sovereign enter in!

Let new and
Nobler life begin!

Thy Holy Spirit
Guide us on

Until the glorious
Crown be won
