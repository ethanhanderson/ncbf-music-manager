Praise To The Lord
The Almighty

Praise to the Lord the almighty
The King of creation!

Oh my soul praise Him
For He is thy health and salvation!

All ye who hear
Now to His temple draw near

Join me in
Glad adoration!

Praise to the Lord who over all 
Things so wondrously reigneth!

Shelters thee under His wings
Yea so gently sustaineth!

Has thou not seen,
How thy desires ever hath been

Granted in what
He ordaineth?

Praise to the Lord who with
Marvelous wisdom hath made thee

Decked thee with health and with
 Loving hand guided and stayed thee

How oft in grief hath not He 
Brought thee relief

Spreading His wings 
To overshade thee!

Praise to the Lord!  
Oh let all that is in me adore Him!

All that has life and breath, 
Come now with praises before Him!

Let the amen
Sound from His people again

Gladly for ever
We adore Him!
