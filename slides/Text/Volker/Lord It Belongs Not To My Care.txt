Title: Lord It Belongs Not To My Care.pro

Lord It Belongs
Not To My Care

Lord it belongs not to my care
Whether I die or live

To love and serve Thee is my share
And this Thy grace must give

If life be long I will be glad
That I may long obey

If short yet why should I be sad
Since all receive their pay

Christ leads me through
No darker rooms

Than He went through before

He that into God’s Kingdom comes
Must enter by this door

Come Lord when grace
Hath made me meet

Thy blessed face to see
For if thy work on earth be sweet

What will Thy Glory be

My knowledge of that life is small
The eye of faith is dim

But tis enough that Christ knows all
And I shall be with Him
