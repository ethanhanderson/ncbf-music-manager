The God Of
Abraham Praise

The God of Abraham praise
Who reigns enthroned above

Ancient of everlasting days
And God of love

Jehovah great I am
By earth and heaven confessed

I bow and bless the sacred name
Forever blest

The God of Abraham praise
At whose supreme command

From earth I rise and seek the joys
At His right hand

I all on earth forsake
Its wisdom fame and power

And Him my only portion make
My shield and tower

He by Himself hath sword
I on His oath depend

I shall on eagles wings upborne
To heaven ascend

I shall behold His face
I shall His power adore

And sing the wonders of His grace
Forever more

The whole triumphant host
Give thanks to God on high

Hail Father Son and Holy Ghost!
They ever cry

Hail Abraham’s God and mine!
I join the heavenly lays

All might and majesty are Thine,
And endless praise
