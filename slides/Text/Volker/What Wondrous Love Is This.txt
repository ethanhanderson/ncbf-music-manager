Title: What Wondrous Love Is This.pro

What Wondrous
Love Is This

What wondrous love is this
O my soul oh my soul

What wondrous love is this
Oh my soul

What wondrous love is this 
That caused the Lord of bliss

To bear the dreadful curse 
For my soul for my soul

To bear the dreadful curse 
For my soul

When I was sinking down
Sinking down sinking down

When I was sinking down
Sinking down

When I was sinking down
Beneath God’s righteous frown

Christ laid aside His crown 
For my soul for my soul

Christ laid aside his crown
For my soul

To God and to the Lamb
I will sing I will sing

To God and to the
Lamb I will sing

To God and to the Lamb 
Who is the great I am

While millions join the theme
I will sing I will sing

While millions join the theme
I will sing

And when from death I’m free
I’ll sing on I’ll sing on

And when from death I’m free
 I’ll sing on

And when from death I’m free
I’ll sing and joyful be

And through eternity
I’ll sing on I’ll sing on

And through eternity
I’ll sing on
