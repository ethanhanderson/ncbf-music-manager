Title: I Sing The Almighty Power Of God.pro

I Sing The Almighty
Power Of God

I sing the almighty power of God
That made the mountains rise

That spread the flowing seas abroad
And built the lofty skies

The sun to rule the day
The moon shines full at His command

And all the
Stars obey

I sing the wisdom that ordained
The sun to rule the day

The moon shines full at His command
And all the stars obey

I sing the goodness of the Lord
That filled the earth with food

He formed the creatures with His word
And then pronounced them good

Lord how Thy wonders are displayed 
Wherever I turn my eye

If I survey the ground I tread
Or gaze upon the sky!

There’s not a plant or flower below
But makes Thy glories known

And clouds arise and tempests blow
By order from Thy throne

While all that borrows life from Thee
Is ever in Thy care

And everywhere that man can be
Oh God Thou art present there!
