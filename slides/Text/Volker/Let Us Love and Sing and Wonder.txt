Let Us Love And
Sing And Wonder

Let us love and
Sing and wonder

Let us praise
The Savior’s name!

He has hushed the
Law’s loud thunder

He has quenched
Mount Sinai’s flame

He has washed us
With his blood

He has brought
Us nigh to God

Let us love the
Lord who bought us

Pitied us
When enemies

Called us by his
Grace and taught us

Gave us ears and
Gave us eyes

He has washed us
With his blood

He presents our
Souls to God

Let us sing though
Fierce temptation

Threaten hard to
Bear us down!

For the Lord our
Strong salvation

Holds in view the
Conqueror’s crown

He who washed us
With his blood

Soon will bring
Us home to God

Let us wonder
Grace and justice

Join and point
To mercy’s store

When through grace in
Christ our trust is

Justice smiles and
Asks no more

He who washed us
With his blood

Has secured our
Way to God

Let us praise and
Join the chorus

Of the saints
Enthroned on high

Here they trusted
Him before us

Now their praises
Fill the sky

You have washed us
With your blood

You are worthy
Lamb of God!
