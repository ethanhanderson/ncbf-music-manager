Holy Holy Holy

Holy holy holy!
Lord God almighty!

Early in the morning
Our song shall rise to Thee

Holy holy holy!
Merciful and mighty!

God in three persons
Blessed trinity!

Holy holy holy!
All the saints adore Thee

Casting down their golden crowns
Around the glassy sea

Cherubim and seraphim
Falling down before Thee

Which wert and art
And evermore shalt be

Holy holy holy!
Though the darkness hide Thee

Though the eye of sinful man
Thy glory may not see

Only Thou art holy
There is none beside Thee

Perfect in power
In love and purity

Holy holy holy!
Lord God Almighty!

All Thy works shall
Praise Thy name

In earth and
Sky and sea

Holy holy holy!
Merciful and mighty!

God in three persons
Blessed trinity!
