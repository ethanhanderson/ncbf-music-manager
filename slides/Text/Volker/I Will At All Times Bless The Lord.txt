Title: I Will At All Times Bless The Lord.pro

I Will At All Times
Bless The Lord

I will at all times
Bless the Lord

His praise my mouth
Will always voice

And in the Lord my
Soul shall boast

The poor will hear
It and rejoice

Come let us
Magnify the Lord

And praise His
Name in unity!

I sought the Lord
And in reply

From all my fears
He rescued me

How radiant those
Who looked to Him!

Their faces free from
Shame shall be

The Lord heard when
This poor man cried

And from all trouble
Set him free

Encircling those who
Fear the Lord

His angel camps
And rescues them

O taste and see
The Lord is good

How blessed are those
Who trust in Him
