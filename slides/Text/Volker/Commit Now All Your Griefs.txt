Title: Commit Now All Your Griefs.pro

Commit Now
All Your Griefs

Commit now all your griefs
And ways into His hands

To His sure truth and tender care
Who earth and Heaven commands

Who points the clouds their course
Whom winds and seas obey

He shall direct your wandering feet
He shall prepare your way

Give to the winds your fears
Hope and be undismayed

God hears your sighs
And counts your tears

God shall lift up your head

Through waves and clouds and storms
He gently clears your way

Wait for His time so shall the night
Soon end in joyous day

Still heavy is your heart
Still sink your spirits down

Cast off the weight let fear depart
And every care be gone

He everywhere has sway
And all things serve His might

His every act pure blessing is
His path unsullied light

Far far above Your thought
His counsel shall appear

When fully He the work has wrought
That caused your needless fear

Leave to his sovereign will
To choose and to command

With wonder filled you then shall own
How wise how strong His hand
