In The Heavens

In the heavens by the Lord’s hand
He established there His throne

Over all is His dominion
He is King and He alone

Bless the Lord you mighty angels
You that hear and do His will

Bless the Lord all you His servants
Who His pleasure do fulfill

Bless the Lord all you His armies
You His works with one accord

In all parts of His dominion
Oh my soul oh bless the Lord
