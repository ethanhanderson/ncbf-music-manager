Title: The Lord Is My Shepherd.pro

The Lord Is
My Shepherd

 The Lord is my shepherd
I shall not want

He makes me lie down
In green pastures

He leads me besides
The still waters

He restoreth my soul

And guides my path in righteousness
For His name’s sake

Surely goodness and loving kindness
Shall follow me all the days of my life

And I will dwell in the house of the Lord
Forever and ever and ever

Though I walk through the valley
Of the shadow of death

I will not fear for
Thou art with me

Thy rod and thy staff
They comfort me

Thou preparest a table

Before me in the
Presence of my enemies

The Lord is my Shepherd
I shall not want
