Title: There Is A Fountain Filled With Blood.pro

There Is A Fountain
Filled With Blood

There is a fountain filled with blood
Drawn from Immanuel’s veins

And sinners plunged beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains

Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains

And sinners plunged beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains

The dying thief rejoiced to see
That fountain in his day

And there may I though vile as he
Wash all my sins away

Wash all my sins away
Wash all my sins away

And there may I though vile as he
Wash all my sins away

Dear dying lamb Thy precious blood
Shall never lose its power

Till all the ransomed church of God
Be saved to sin no more

Be saved to sin no more!
Be saved to sin no more!

Till all the ransomed church of God
Be saved to sin no more

Ever since by faith I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply

Redeeming love has been my theme
And shall be till I die

And shall be till I die
And shall be till I die

Redeeming love has been my theme
And shall be till I die
