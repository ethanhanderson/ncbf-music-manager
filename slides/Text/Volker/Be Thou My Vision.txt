Be Thou My Vision

Be Thou my vision
O Lord of my heart

Naught be all else to me
Save that Thou art

Thou my best thought
By day or by night

Waking or sleeping
Thy presence my light

Be Thou my wisdom
And Thou my true word

I ever with Thee
And Thou with me Lord

Thou my great Father
I Thy true son

Thou in me dwelling
And I with Thee one

Riches I heed not
Nor man’s empty praise

Thou mine inheritance
Now and always

Thou and Thou only
First in my heart

High king of heaven
My treasure Thou art

High king of heaven
My victory won

May I reach heaven’s joys
Oh bright heaven’s Sun!

Heart of my own heart
Whatever befall

Still be my vision
Oh ruler of all
