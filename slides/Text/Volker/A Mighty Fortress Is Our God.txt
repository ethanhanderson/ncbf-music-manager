Title: A Mighty Fortress Is Our God (Ein Feste Burg)

A Mighty Fortress
Is Our God

A mighty fortress is our God
A bulwark never failing

Our helper He amidst the flood
Of mortal ills prevailing

For still our ancient foe
Doth seek to work us woe

His craft and power are great
And armed with cruel hate

On earth is not
His equal

Did we in our own strength confide
Our striving would be losing

Were not the right man on our side
The man of God’s own choosing

Dost ask who that may be?
Christ Jesus it is He

Lord sabaoth His name
From age to age the same

And He must
Win the battle

And though this world
With devils filled

Should threaten
To undo us

We will not fear
For God hath willed

The truth to
Triumph through us

The prince of darkness grim
We tremble not for him

His rage we can endure
For lo his doom is sure

One little word
Shall fell him

That Word above all earthly powers
No thanks to them abideth

The Spirit and the gifts are ours
Through Him who with us sideth

Let goods and kindred go
This mortal life also

The body they may kill
God’s truth abideth still

His kingdom
Is forever
