Surely God Is Good

Surely God is good
To all the pure in heart

But as for me my
Feet had almost slipped

I nearly lost my grip
For I envied the arrogant

They are free
From my burdens

Surely I in vain
Have kept my my heart pure

And surely they are strong 
And free from trials

While I am so confused
Then I entered Your holy place

Then I saw
Their destiny

Surely they're cast down
As those on slippery ground

As dreams fade when we wake
So they become

Completely swept away
In my heart I was arrogant

Like a beast before You
Yet always You are near

You guide me by Your word
And always my lord God

You are my strength
My portion You will be

You're my refuge
My Sovereign Lord

I will sing of
Your awesome deeds

Yet always You are near
You guide me by Your Word

And always my Lord God 
You are my strength

My portion
You will be

You're my refuge
My Sovereign Lord

I will sing of
Your awesome deeds

You're my refuge
My Sovereign Lord

I will sing of
Your awesome deeds

Surely God is good
Surely God is good
