Title: Day By Day.pro

Day By Day

Day by day
And with each passing moment

Strength I find
To meet my trials here

Trusting in my Father’s
Wise bestowment

I’ve no cause
For worry or for fear

He whose heart is kind
Beyond all measure

Gives unto each day
What He deems best

Lovingly it’s part
Of pain and pleasure

Mingling toil with
Peace and rest

Every day the Lord Himself
Is near me

With a special mercy
For each hour

All my cares He fain would bear
And cheer me

He whose name is
Counselor and power

The protection of His child
And treasure

Is a charge that
On Himself He laid

As your days your strength
Shall be in measure

This the pledge
To me He made

Help me then
In every tribulation

So to trust
Your promises oh Lord

That I lose not
Faith’s sweet consolation

Offered me
Within Your holy Word

Help me, Lord,
When toil and trouble meeting

Ever to take
As from a father’s hand

One by one the days
The moments fleeting

Til I reach
The promised land
