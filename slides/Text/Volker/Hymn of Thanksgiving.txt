Hymn Of Thanksgiving

From the first bright light of morning
To the last warm glow of dusk

Every breath we take is sacred
For it is God’s gift to us

In thanksgiving let us praise Him
In thanksgiving let us sing!

Songs of praise and adoration
To our gracious Lord and king

In the season of our plenty
In the season of our need

We will find his grace sufficient
We will find his love complete

In thanksgiving let us praise Him
In thanksgiving let us sing!

Songs of praise and adoration
To our gracious Lord and king

Safe within his hand that guides us
Hidden in his healing wings

Day by day his love provides us
Every good and perfect thing

In thanksgiving let us praise Him
In thanksgiving let us sing!

Songs of praise and adoration
To our gracious Lord and king.
