Joyful and triumphant

Oh come ye oh come ye 
To Bethlehem

Come and behold Him
Born the king of angels

Oh come let us adore Him

Light of Light begotten

Lo He abhors not 
The virgin’s womb

Sing in exultation

Of heaven above

Glory to God
All glory in the highest

Yea Lord we greet thee
Born this happy morning

Jesus to thee be 
All glory given

Word of the Father 
Now in flesh appearing

Oh come let us adore Him
Oh come let us adore Him

Oh come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord
