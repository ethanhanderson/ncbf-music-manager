Title: All Praise To God Who Reigns Above.pro

All Praise To God
Who Reigns Above

All praise to God
Who reigns above

The God of
All creation

The God of wonders
Power and love

The God of
Our salvation

With healing balm
My soul He fills

The God who
Every sorrow stills

To God All
Praise and glory!

I cried to Him
In time of need

Lord God oh
Hear my calling!

For death He gave
Me life indeed

And kept my
Feet from falling

For this my thanks
Shall endless be

Oh thank Him
Thank our God with me

To God all
Praise and glory!

Ye who confess
Christ’s holy name

To God give
Praise and glory!

Ye who the Father’s
Power proclaim

To God give
Praise and glory!

All idols underfoot
Be trod

The Lord is God
The Lord is God!

To God be all
Praise and glory!

The come before
His presence now

And banish fear
And sadness

To your redeemer
Pay your vow

And sing with
Joy and gladness

Though great distress
My soul befell

The Lord my God
Did all things well

To God all
Praise and glory!
