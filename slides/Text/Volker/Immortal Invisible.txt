Immortal Invisible

Immortal invisible
God only wise

In light inaccessible
Hid from our eyes

Most blessed most glorious
The ancient of days

Almighty victorious
Thy great name we praise

Unresting unhasting
And silent as light

Nor wanting nor wasting
Thou rulest in might

Thy justice like mountains
High soaring above

Thy clouds which are fountains
Of goodness and love

Great Father of glory
Pure Father of light

Thine angels adore Thee
All veiling their sight

All praise we would render
Oh help us to see

Tis only the splendor
Of light hideth Thee!
