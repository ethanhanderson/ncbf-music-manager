Title: It Is Well With My Soul.pro

It Is Well With
My Soul

When peace like a river
 Attendeth my way

When sorrows
Like sea billows roll

Whatever my lot
Thou hast taught me to say

It is well
It is well with my soul

It is well
With my soul

It is well
It is well with my soul

Though Satan should buffet
Though trials should come

Let this blest
Assurance control

That Christ has regarded
My helpless estate

And hath shed
His own blood for my soul

It is well
With my soul

It is well
It is well with my soul

My sin oh the bliss
Of this glorious thought

My sin not in part
But the whole

Is nailed to the cross
And I bear it no more

Praise the Lord
Praise the Lord oh my soul!

It is well
With my soul

It is well
It is well with my soul

And Lord haste the day
When my faith shall be sight

The clouds be rolled back
As a scroll

The trump shall resound
And the Lord shall descend

Even so
It is well with my soul

It is well
With my soul

It is well
It is well with my soul
