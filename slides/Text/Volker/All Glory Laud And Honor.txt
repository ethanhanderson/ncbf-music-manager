Title: All Glory Laud And Honor.pro

All Glory
Laud And Honor

All glory laud and honor
To Thee redeemer king

To Whom the lips of children 
Made sweet hosannas ring

Thou art the king of Israel
Thou David’s royal son

Who in the Lord’s name comest
The king and blessed one!

The people of the Hebrews
With palms before Thee went

Our praise and prayer and anthems 
Before Thee we present

To Thee before Thy passion
They sang their hymns of praise

To Thee now high exalted
Our melody we raise

Thou didst accept their praises
Accept the praise we bring

Who in all good delightest
Thou good and gracious king!

All glory laud and honor
To Thee redeemer king

To Whom the lips of children 
Made sweet hosannas ring
