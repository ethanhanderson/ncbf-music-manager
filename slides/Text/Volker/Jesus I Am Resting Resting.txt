Jesus I Am
Resting Resting

Jesus I am resting resting
In the joy of what thou art

I am finding out the greatness
Of thy loving heart

Thou hast bid me gaze upon thee
As thy beauty fills my soul

For by thy transforming power
Thou hast made me whole

Oh how great thy loving kindness
Vaster broader than the sea!

Oh how marvelous thy goodness
Lavished all on me!

Yes I rest in Thee beloved
Know what wealth of grace is thine

Know thy certainty of promise
And have made it mine

Simply trusting thee Lord Jesus
I behold thee as thou art

And thy love so pure so changeless
Satisfies my heart

Satisfies its deepest longings
Meets supplies its every need

Compasseth me round with blessings
Thine is love indeed.

Ever lift thy face upon me
As I work and wait for thee

Resting ‘neath thy smile Lord Jesus
Earth’s dark shadows flee

Brightness of my Father’s glory
Sunshine of my Father’s face

Keep me ever trusting resting
Fill me with thy grace

Jesus I am resting resting
In the joy of what thou art

I am finding out the greatness
Of thy loving heart
