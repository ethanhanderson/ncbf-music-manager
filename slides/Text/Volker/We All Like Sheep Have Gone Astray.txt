We All Like Sheep
Have Gone Astray

We all like sheep have gone astray
Each one has turned to his own way

But the Lord has laid on Him
The iniquity of us all.

We all like sheep have gone astray
Each one has turned to his own way

But the Lord has laid on Him
The iniquity of us all

He bore our sorrows and our shame
He took away our sins

And he has healed
Us with his stripes

And made us whole again
He makes us whole again!

We all like sheep have gone astray
Each one has turned to his own way

But the Lord has laid on Him
The iniquity of us all

He bore our sorrows and our shame
He took away our sins

And he has healed
Us with his stripes

And made us whole again
He make us whole again!

We all like sheep have gone astray
Each one has turned to his own way

But the Lord has laid on Him
The iniquity of us all.
