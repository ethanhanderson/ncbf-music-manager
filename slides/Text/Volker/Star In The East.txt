Title: Star In The East.pro

Star in the East

Hail the blest morn
See the great Mediator

Down from the regions
Of glory descend!

Shepherds go worship the
Babe in the manger

Lo for his guard the
Bright angles attend

Brightest and best of the
Sons of the morning!

Dawn on our darkness
And lend us thine aid

Star in the east
The horizon adorning

Guide where our infant
Redeemer was laid.

Say shall we yield him
In costly devotion

Odours of Eden
And offerings divine

Gems from the mountain
And pearls from the ocean

Myrrh from the forest
And gold from the mine!

Brightest and best of the
Sons of the morning!

Dawn on our darkness
And lend us thine aid

Star in the east
The horizon adorning

Guide where our infant
Redeemer was laid

Vainly we offer each
Ample oblation

Vainly with gold we
His favor secure

Richer by far is the
Heart’s adoration

Dearer to God are the
Prayers of the poor

Brightest and best of the
Sons of the morning!

Dawn on our darkness
And lend us thine aid

Star in the east
The horizon adorning

Guide where our infant
Redeemer was laid
