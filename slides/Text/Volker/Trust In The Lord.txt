The Lord

Trust in the Lord 
With all your heart

Don’t lean on your
Own understanding

Acknowledge Him

Your paths straight

Do not be wise
In your own eyes

Fear the Lord
And turn from evil

In your own eyes

Fear the Lord and
Turn from evil

Don’t lean on your
Own understanding

In all your ways
Acknowledge Him

Your paths straight

To your body

And refreshment
To your bones

It will be healing
To your body

And refreshment
To your bones

Own understanding

In all your ways
Acknowledge Him

And He will make
Your paths straight
