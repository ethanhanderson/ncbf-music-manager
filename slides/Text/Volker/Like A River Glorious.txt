Like A River Glorious

Like a river glorious
Is God’s perfect peace

Over all victorious
In its bright increase.

Perfect yet it floweth
Fuller every day

Perfect yet it groweth
Deeper all the way

Stayed upon Jehovah
Hearts are fully blest

Finding as He promised
Perfect peace and rest

Hidden in the hollow
Of His blessed hand

Never foe can follow
Never traitor stand

Not a surge of worry
Not a shade of care

Not a blast of hurry
Touch the spirit there

Stayed upon Jehovah
Hearts are fully blest

Finding as He promised
Perfect peace and rest

Every joy or trial
Falleth from above

Traced upon our dial
By the sun of love

We may trust Him fully
All for us to do

They who trust Him wholly
Find Him wholly true

Stayed upon Jehovah
Hearts are fully blest

Finding as He promised
Perfect peace and rest
