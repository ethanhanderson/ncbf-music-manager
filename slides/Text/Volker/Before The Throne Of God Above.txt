Title: Before The Throne Of God Above.pro

Before The Throne
Of God Above

Before the throne of God above
I have a strong and perfect plea

A great high priest whose name is love
Who ever lives and pleads for me

My name is graven on this hands
My name is written on his heart

I know that while in heaven he stands
No tongue can bid me hence depart

No tongue can bid
Me hence depart

When Satan tempts me to despair
And tells me of the guilt within

Upward I look and see him there
Who made an end of all my sin

Because a sinless Savior died
My sinful soul is counted free

To look on Him and pardon me

For God the just is satisfied
To look on Him and pardon me

To look on Him and pardon me

To look on Him
And pardon me

Behold him there the risen lamb
My perfect spotless righteousness

The great unchangeable I am
The King of glory and of grace

One in himself I cannot die
My soul is purchased by his blood

My life is hid with Christ on high
With Christ my savior and my God

With Christ my Savior
And my God
