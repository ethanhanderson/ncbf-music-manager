Title: My Heart Is Not Exaulted Lord.pro

My Heart Is Not
Exalted Lord

My heart is not exalted Lord
Nor haughty is my eye

I do not deal with matters great
Or things for me too high

I have composed and calmed my soul
I’m like a little child

Now weaned he on his mother rests
With soul subdued and mild

My heart is not exalted Lord
Nor haughty is my eye

I do not deal with matters great
Or things for me too high

Yes like a child who has been weaned
My soul is calmed in me

Hope in the Lord oh Israel
Now and eternally
