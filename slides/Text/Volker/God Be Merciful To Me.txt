Title: God Be Merciful To Me.pro

God Be Merciful
To Me

God be merciful to me
On Thy grace I rest my plea

Plenteous in compassion Thou
Blot out my transgressions now

Wash me make me pure within
Cleanse oh cleanse me from my sin

My transgressions I confess
Grief and guilt my soul oppress

I have sinned against Thy grace
And provoked Thee to Thy face

I confess Thy judgment just
Speechless I Thy mercy trust

I am evil born in sin
Thou desirest truth within

Thou alone my Savior art
Teach Thy wisdom to my heart

Make me pure Thy grace bestow
Wash me whiter than the snow

Broken humbled to the dust
By Thy wrath and judgment just

Let my contrite heart rejoice
And in gladness hear Thy voice

From my sins oh hide Thy face
Blot them out in boundless grace

Gracious God my heart renew
Make my spirit right and true

Cast me not away from Thee
Let Thy Spirit dwell in me

Thy salvation's joy impart
Steadfast make my willing heart

Sinners then shall learn from me
And return oh God to Thee

Savior all my guilt remove
And my tongue shall sing Thy love

Touch my silent lips oh Lord
And my mouth shall praise accord

Touch my silent lips oh Lord
And my mouth shall praise accord
