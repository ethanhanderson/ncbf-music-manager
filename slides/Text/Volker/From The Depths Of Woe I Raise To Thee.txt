Title: From The Depths Of Woe I Raise To Thee.pro

From The Depths
Of Woe

From the depths of woe I raise to Thee 
The voice of lamentation

Lord turn a gracious ear to me
And hear my supplication

If Thou iniquities dost mark
Our secret sins and misdeeds dark

Men

Oh who shall stand before Thee?

Women

Who shall stand before Thee?

Men

Oh who shall stand before Thee?

Women

Who shall stand before Thee?

To wash away the crimson stain
Grace grace alone availeth

Our works alas are all in vain
In much the best life faileth

No man can glory in Thy sight
All must alike confess Thy might

Men

And live alone by mercy

Women

Live alone by mercy

Men

And live alone by mercy

Women

Live alone by mercy

Therefore my trust is in the Lord
And not in mine own merit

On Him my soul shall rest His word
Upholds my fainting spirit

His promised mercy is my fort
My comfort and my sweet support

Men

I wait for it with patience

Women

Wait for it with patience

Men

I wait for it with patience

Women

Wait for it with patience

What though I wait the live long night
And til the dawn appeareth

My heart still trusteth in His might
It doubteth not nor feareth

Do thus oh ye of Israel's seed
Ye of the Spirit born indeed

Men

And wait til God appeareth

Women

Wait til God appeareth

Men

And wait til God appeareth

Women

Wait til God appeareth

Though great our sins
And sore our woes

His grace much
More aboundeth

His helping love no limit knows
Our upmost need it soundeth

Our Shepherd good and true is He
Who will at last His Israel free

Men

From all their sin and sorrow

Women

All their sin and sorrow

Men

From all their sin and sorrow

Women

All their sin and sorrow

Men

From all their sin and sorrow

Women

All their sin and sorrow

Men

From all their sin and sorrow

Women

All their sin and sorrow
