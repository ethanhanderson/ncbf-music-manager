Title: Man of Sorrows What a Name.pro

Man Of Sorrows

Man of sorrows what a name
For the son of God who came

Ruined sinners to reclaim
Hallelujah what a savior!

Bearing shame and scoffing rude
In my place condemned He stood

Sealed my pardon with his blood
Hallelujah what a savior!

Guilty vile and helpless we
Spotless lamb of God was He

Full atonement can it be?
Hallelujah what a savior!

Lifted up was He to die
It is finished was his cry

Now in heaven exalted high
Hallelujah what a savior!

When He comes our glorious king
All His ransomed home to bring

Then anew this song we’ll sing
Hallelujah what a savior!
