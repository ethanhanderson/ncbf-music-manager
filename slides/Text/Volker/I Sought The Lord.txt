Title: I Sought The Lord.pro

I Sought
The Lord

I sought the Lord
 And afterward I knew

He moved my soul 
To seek Him seeking me

It was not I that found
Oh Savior true

No I was found
Of Thee

Thou did reach forth
Thy hand and mine enfold

I walked and sank not
On the storm vexed sea

Twas not so much
That I on Thee took hold

As Thou dear
Lord on me

I find I walk I love
But oh the whole

Of love is but
My turning Lord to Thee

For Thou wert long
 Beforehand with my soul

Always Thou
Lovedst me
