Title: Though Troubles Assail Us.pro

Though Troubles
Assail Us

Though troubles assail us 
And dangers affright

Though friends should all fail us
And foes all unite

Yet one thing secures us
Whatever betide

The promise assures us
The Lord will provide

The birds without garner
Or storehouse are fed

From them let us learn
To trust God for our bread

His saints what is fitting
Shall never be denied

So long as tis written
The Lord will provide

When Satan assails us
To stop up our path

And courage all fails us
We triumph by faith.

He cannot take from us
Though oft he has tried

This heart cheering promise
The Lord will provide

No strength of our own 
And no goodness we claim

Yet since we have known
Of the Savior’s great name

In this our strong tower
For safety we hide

The Lord is our power
The Lord will provide
