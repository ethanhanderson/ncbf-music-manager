Rock of Ages

Rock of ages cleft for me
Let me hide myself in Thee

Let the water and the blood
From Thy riven side which flowed

Be of sin the double cure
Cleanse me of its guilt and power

Not the labors of my hands
Can fulfill Thy law’s demands

Could my zeal no respite know
Could my tears for ever flow

All for sin could not atone
Thou must save and Thou alone

Nothing in my hand I bring
Simply to Thy cross I cling

Naked come to Thee for dress
Helpless look to Thee for grace

Foul I to the fountain fly
Wash me savior or I die

While I draw this fleeting breath
When mine eyes are closed in death

When I soar through tracts unknown
See Thee on Thy judgment throne

Rock of ages cleft for me
Let me hide myself in Thee
