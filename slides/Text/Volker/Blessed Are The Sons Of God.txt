Blessed Are The
Sons Of God

Blessed are the
Sons of God

They are bought with
Christ’s own blood

They are ransomed
From the grave

Life eternal
They shall have

With them numbered
May we be

Here and
In eternity

They are
Justified by grace

They enjoy the
Savior’s peace

All their sins
Are washed away

They shall stand in
God’s great day

With them numbered
May we be

Here and
In eternity

They are light
Upon the earth

Children of a
Heavenly birth

One with God
With Jesus one

Glory is in
Them begun

With them numbered
May we be

Here and
In eternity
