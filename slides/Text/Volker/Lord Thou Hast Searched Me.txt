Title: Lord Thou Hast Searched Me.pro

Lord Thou Hast
Searched Me

Lord Thou hast searched
Me and dost know

Wherever I rest
Wherever I go

Thou knowest all
That I have planned

And all my ways
Are in Thy hand

My words from Thee
I cannot hide

I feel Thy power
On every side

Oh wondrous knowledge
Awful might

Unfathomed depth
Unmeasured height!

Where can I go
Apart from Thee

Or whither from
Thy presence flee?

In heaven it is
Thy dwelling fair

In death's abode
Lo Thou art there

If I the wings
Of morning take

And far away
My dwelling make

The hand that
Leadeth me is Thine

And my support
Thy power divine

If deepest darkness
Cover me

The darkness hideth
Not from Thee

To Thee both night
And day are bright

The darkness shineth
As the light

The darkness shineth
As the light

The darkness shineth
As the light
