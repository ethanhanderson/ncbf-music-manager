Title: You Are The Song Of My Life.pro

You Are The
Song Of My Life

You are the
Song of my life

You heal the
Wrong of my life

And you change the
Meaning of all that I see

Great are the
Wonders of Thee!

You are the
Wind in my sail

You start me
Again when I fail

And you chase the
Sorrow out of the rain

And nothing you
Touch stays the same!

Hallelujah to the
Ancient of days

To the one who
Has purchased my fears

Hallelujah to the
Mender of ways

To the one who has
Restored the years

You are the
Song of my life

The song I’ll be
Singing forever

And you chase the
Sorrow out of the rain

And nothing you
Touch stays the same!

Hallelujah to the
Ancient of days

To the one who has
Purchased my fears

Hallelujah to the
Mender of ways

To the one who has
Restored the years

Hallelujah to the
Ancient of days

To the one who has
Purchased my fears

Hallelujah to the
Mender of ways

To the one who has
Restored the years

To the one who has
Restored the years

To the one who has
Restored the years
