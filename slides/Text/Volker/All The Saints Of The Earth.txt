All The Saints
Of The Earth

All the saints of the earth
Will give thanks to Thee oh Lord

When they have heard 
The words of Thy mouth

And they will sing 
Of the ways of the Lord

For great is the
Glory of the Lord

For though the Lord is exalted
Yet He regards the lowly

But the haughty 
He knows from afar

All the saints of the earth
Will give thanks to Thee oh Lord

When they have heard 
The words of Thy mouth

And they will sing 
Of the ways of the Lord

For great is the
Glory of the Lord

For though the Lord is exalted
Yet He regards the lowly

But the haughty 
He knows from afar

All the saints of the earth
Will give thanks to Thee oh Lord

When they have heard 
The words of Thy mouth
