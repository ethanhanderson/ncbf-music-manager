Title: Stricken Smitten And Afflicted.pro

Stricken Smitten
And Afflicted

Stricken smitten
And afflicted

See him dying
On the tree!

Tis the Christ by
Man rejected

Yes my soul
Tis he tis he!

Tis the long
Expected Prophet

David’s son yet
David’s Lord

Proofs I see
Sufficient of it

Tis the true and
Faithful word

Tell me ye who
Hear him groaning

Was there ever
Grief like his?

Friends through fear
His cause disowning

Foes insulting
His distress

Many hands were raised
To wound him

None would
Interpose to save

But the deepest stroke
That pierced him

Was the stroke
That justice gave

Ye who think of
Sin but lightly

Nor suppose
The evil great

Here may view
Its nature rightly

Here its guilt
May estimate

Mark the
Sacrifice appointed

See who bears
The awful load

Tis the Word the
Lord’s anointed

Son of Man and
Son of God

Here we have a
Firm foundation

Here the refuge
Of the lost

Christ’s the Rock
Of our salvation

His the name of
Which we boast

Lamb of God for
Sinners wounded

Sacrifice to
Cancel guilt!

None shall ever
Be confounded

Who on Him their
Hope have built
