Title: The Great Storm Is Over.pro

The Great Storm
Is Over

Alleluia the great storm is over
Lift up your wings and fly!

Alleluia the great storm is over
Lift up your wings and fly!

The thunder and lightening 
Gave voice to the night

The little lame child
Cried aloud in her fright

Hush little baby
A story I will tell

Of a love that has conquered
The powers of hell

Alleluia the great storm is over
Lift up your wings and fly!

Alleluia the great storm is over
Lift up your wings and fly

Sweetness in the air
And justice on the wind

Laughter in the house
Where the mourners have been

The deaf shall have music
The blind have new eyes

The standard of death
Is taken down by surprise

Alleluia the great storm is over
Lift up your wings and fly!

Alleluia the great storm is over
Lift up your wings and fly!

Release for the captives
And end to the wars

New streams in the desert
New hope for the poor

The little lame children
Will dance as they sing

And play with the bears
And the lions in spring

Alleluia the great storm is over
Lift up your wings and fly!

Alleluia the great storm is over
Lift up your wings and fly!

Hush little baby
Let go of your fear

The Lord loves His own
And your mother is here

The child fell asleep 
As the lantern did burn

The mother sang on 
Till her bridegroom’s return.

Alleluia the great storm is over
Lift up your wings and fly!

Alleluia the great storm is over
Lift up your wings and fly!
