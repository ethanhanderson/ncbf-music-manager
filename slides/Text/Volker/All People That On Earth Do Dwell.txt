All People That On
Earth Do Dwell

All people that on
Earth do dwell

Sing to the Lord with
Cheerful voice

Him serve with fear
His praise forth tell

Come ye before him
And rejoice

The Lord ye know
Is God indeed

Without our aid
He did us make

We are his folk
He doth us feed

And for his sheep
He doth us take

Oh enter then
His gates with praise

Approach with joy
His courts unto

Praise laud and
Bless His name always

For it is
Seemly so to do

For why the Lord
Our God is good

His mercy is
Forever sure

His truth at all
Times firmly stood

And shall from age
To age endure

Praise God from
Whom all blessings flow

Praise Him all creatures
Here below

Praise Him above ye
Heavenly hosts

Praise Father Son
And Holy Ghost

Amen
