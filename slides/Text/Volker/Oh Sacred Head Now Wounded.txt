Title: Oh Sacred Head Now Wounded.pro

Oh Sacred Head
Now Wounded

Oh sacred head now wounded
With grief and shame weighed down

Now scornfully surrounded
With thorns thine only crown

Oh sacred Head what glory
What bliss till now was thine!

Yet though despised and gory
I joy to call thee mine

What thou my Lord has suffered
Was all for sinners’ gain

Mine mine was the transgression
But thine the deadly pain

Lo here I fall my savior!
Tis I deserve thy place

Look on me with thy favor
Vouchsafe to me thy grace

What language shall I borrow
To thank thee dearest Friend

For this thy dying sorrow
Thy pity without end?

Oh make me thine forever
And should I fainting be

Lord let me never never
Outlive my love to thee
