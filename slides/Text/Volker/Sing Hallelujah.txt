Sing Hallelujah

Sing Hallelujah praise the Lord!
Sing with a cheerful voice

Exalt our God with one accord
And in His name rejoice

Never cease to sing
Thou ransomed host!

Praise Father, Son
And Holy Ghost!

Until in realms of endless light
Your praises shall unite

There we to all eternity
Shall join the angelic lays

And sing in perfect harmony
To God our Savior’s praise

He hath redeemed
Us by His blood

And made us kings
And priests to God

For us for us the Lamb was slain!
Praise ye the Lord amen!
