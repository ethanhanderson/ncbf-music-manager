Joy To The World

Joy to the world! 
The Lord is come

Let earth receive
 Her King

Let every heart 
Prepare him room.

And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing

And heaven and heaven 
And nature sing

Joy to the earth! 
The Savior reigns

Let men their
Songs employ

While fields and floods
Rocks hills and plains

Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy

Repeat repeat
The sounding joy

No more let sins 
And sorrows grow

Nor thorns infest
The ground

He comes to make 
This blessing flow

Far as the curse is found 
Far as the curse is found

Far as far as the
Curse is found

He rules the world 
With truth and grace

And makes the
Nations prove

The glories of 
His righteousness

And wonders of his love
And wonders of his love

And wonders
Wonders of his love
