Title: He Giveth More Grace.pro

He Giveth More Grace

He giveth more grace
When the burdens grow greater

He sendeth more strength
When the labors increase

To added affliction
He addeth His mercy

To multiplied trials
His multiplied peace

His love has no limit
His grace has no measure

His power has no boundary
Known unto men

For out of His infinite 
Riches in Jesus

He giveth and giveth
And giveth again

When we have exhausted
Our store of endurance

When our strength has failed
Ere the day is half done

When we reach the end of
Our hoarded resources
