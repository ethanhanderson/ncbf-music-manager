Waiting For
The Lord

He is my light
Yes the Lord my salvation

With Him as my stronghold
Whom shall I fear?

When evil assails me
When I am surrounded

I will find my life in the Lord

There is one thing I will ask of Him
And I will seek it forever

Lord my one desire is to dwell
Within your household and ever

To behold the beauty of God
And to grow as a son in His courts

He is my light
Yes the Lord my salvation

With Him as my stronghold
Whom shall I fear?

When evil assails me
When I am surrounded

I will find my life in the Lord

Teach me of your ways oh Lord
And lead me in the path of Your kingdom

Hear me when I cry aloud

And answer for your
Word is my freedom

I believe I shall
See the goodness

Of God in the
Land of the living

Waiting for the Lord
I will be strong

And let my heart
Take courage

I will wait yea
Wait for the Lord

I will wait
For the Lord

He is my light
Yes the Lord my salvation

With Him as my strong hold
Whom shall I fear?

When evil assails me
When I am surrounded

I will find my
Life in the Lord
