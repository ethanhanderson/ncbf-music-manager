Whatever My God
Ordains Is Right

Whatever my God
Ordains is right

His holy
Will abideth

I will be still
Whatever He doth

And follow where
He guideth

He is my God though
Dark my road

He holds me that
I shall not fall

Wherefore to Him
I leave it all

Whatever my God
Ordains is right

He never will
Deceive me

He leads me by
The proper path

I know He will
Not leave me

I take content
What He hath sent

His hand can turn
My griefs away

And patiently I
Wait His day

Whatever my God
Ordains is right

Though now this
Cup in drinking

May bitter seem to
My faint heart

I take it
All unshrinking

My God is true
Each morn anew

Sweet comfort yet
Shall fill my heart

And pain and sorrow
Shall depart

Whatever my God
Ordains is right

Here shall my stand be taken
Though sorrow need

Or death be mine
Yet am I not forsaken

My Father’s care is
Around me there

He holds me that
I shall not fall

And so to Him
I leave it all
