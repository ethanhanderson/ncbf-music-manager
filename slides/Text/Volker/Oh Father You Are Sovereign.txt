Title: Oh Father You Are Sovereign.pro

Oh Father You
Are Sovereign

Oh Father you are sovereign
In all the worlds you made

Your mighty word was spoken 
And light and life obeyed

Your voice commands the seasons
And bounds the ocean’s shore

Sets stars within their courses
And stills the tempest’s roars

Of Father you are sovereign 
In all affairs of man

No powers of death or darkness 
Can thwart your perfect plan

All chance and change transcending
Supreme in time and space

You hold your trusting children
Secure in your embrace

Oh Father you are sovereign
The Lord of human pain

Transmuting earthly sorrows 
To gold of heavenly gain

All evil overruling
As none but conqueror could

Your love pursues its purpose
Our souls’ eternal good

Oh Father you are sovereign!
We see you dimly now

But soon before your triumph
Earth’s every knee shall bow

With this glad hope before us
Our faith springs up anew

Our sovereign Lord and Savior
We trust and worship you
