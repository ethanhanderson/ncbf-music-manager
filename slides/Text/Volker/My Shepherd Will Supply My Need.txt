Title: My Shepherd Will Supply My Need.pro

My Shepherd Will
Supply My Need

My Shepherd will supply my need
Jehovah is His name

In pastures green He makes me feed
Beside the living stream

He brings me my wandering spirit back
When I forsake His ways

And leads me for His mercy’s sake
In paths of truth and grace

When I walk through
The shades of death

Thy Presence
Is my stay

One word of Thy supporting breath
Drives all the fears away

Thy hand in sight of all my foes
Doth still my table spread

My cup with blessings overflows
Thine oil anoints my head

The sure provisions of my God
Attend me all my days

Oh may Thy house be my abode
And all my work be praise!

There would I find a settled rest
While others go and come

No more a stranger nor a guest
But like a child at home

No more a stranger nor a guest
But like a child at home
