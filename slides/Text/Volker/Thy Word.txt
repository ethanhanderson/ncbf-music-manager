Thy Word

Thy word is a lamp
Unto my feet

And a light
Unto my path

Thy word is a lamp
Unto my feet

And a light
Unto my path

When I feel afraid
Think I’ve lost my way

Still you there
Right beside me

And nothing
Will I fear

As long as
You are near

You are with
Me to the end!

Thy word is a lamp
Unto my feet

And a light
Unto my path

Thy word is a lamp
Unto my feet

And a light
Unto my path

I will not forget
Your love for me and yet

My heart forever
Is wandering

Jesus be my guide
And hold me to your side

And you will love
Me to the end

Thy word is a lamp
Unto my feet

And a light
Unto my path

Thy word is a lamp
Unto my feet

And a light
Unto my path

When truth is
What I seek

And wisdom’s
Beyond my reach

I come to you
Empty handed

You say boldly
To draw near

To the throne
Without your fear

And I will give just
What you need!

Thy word is a lamp
Unto my feet

And a light
Unto my path

And a light
Unto my path

And a light
Unto my path
