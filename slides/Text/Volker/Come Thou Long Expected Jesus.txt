Title: Come Thou Long Expected Jesus.pro

Come Thou Long
Expected Jesus

Come Thou
Long expected Jesus

Born to set
Thy people free

From our fears
And sins release us

Let us find our
Rest in Thee

Israel’s strength
And consolation

Hope of all the
Earth Thou art

Dear desire of
Every nation

Joy of every
Longing heart

Joy to those who
Long to see thee

Day spring from
On high appear

Come thou promised
Rod of Jesse

Of thy birth we
Long to hear!

Over the hills the
Angels singing

News glad tidings
Of a birth

Go to him your
Praises bringing

Christ the Lord
Has come to earth

Come to earth to
Taste our sadness

He whose glories
Know no end

By his life he
Brings us gladness

Our redeemer
Shepherd friend

Leaving riches
Without number

Born within
A cattle stall

This the
Everlasting wonder

Christ was born
The Lord of all

Born Thy people
To deliver

Born a Child
And yet a King

Born to reign
In us forever

Now Thy gracious
Kingdom bring

By Thine own
Eternal Spirit

Rule in all our
Hearts alone

By Thine all
Sufficient merit

Raise us to Thy
Glorious throne
