Awesome God

When He rolls us his sleeves He 
Ain’t just putting on the ritz

Our God is an
Awesome God

There’s thunder in his footsteps
 And lightning in his fists

Our God is an
Awesome God

And the Lord He wasn’t joking
 When He kicked  ‘em out of Eden

It wasn’t for no reason 
That He shed His blood

His return is very close 
So you better be believing

That our God is
An awesome God

Our God is an awesome God
He reigns from heaven above

With wisdom power and love 
Our God is an awesome God

When the sky was starless
In the void of the night

Our God is an
Awesome God

He spoke into the darkness
And created the light

Our God is an
Awesome God

The judgment and wrath
He poured out on Sodom

The mercy and grace 
He gave us at the cross

I hope that we have not
Too quickly forgotten that

Our God is an
Awesome God

Our God is an awesome God
He reigns from heaven above

With wisdom power and love
Our God is an awesome God

Our God is an awesome God
Our God is an awesome God
