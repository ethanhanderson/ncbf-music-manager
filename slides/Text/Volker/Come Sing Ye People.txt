Title: Come Sing Ye People.pro

Come Sing
Ye People

Come sing ye people
To the Lord

And make His
Glories known

Come see what wonders
He has wrought

To claim us
For his own

His anger burned
A little while

But now shall
Burn no more

With peace he bids
Us come to Him

And see what
Lies in store

For they who walk
In darkness grim

Will see a
Blazing light

And they who
Live in shadow dim

Upon them
Light will shine

He’ll multiply the
People’s joy

They’ll sing before
His throne

Like men rejoice
At harvest time

Or when foes
Are overthrown

For God shall make
Their burden light

Their yoke he’ll
Take away

The rod of the
Oppressor break

On that most
Glorious day

The cloaks of battle
Rolled in blood

Will be no
More for war

Instead they’ll be
A burning fire

To light our
Coming Lord

For unto us a
Child a born

To us a Son
Is given

The government
Will rest on him

The eternal one
Of heaven

And we will call
Him Wonderful

Our Counselor
And God

Eternal father
Prince of peace

Is this most
Glorious one

From then on
And forever more

His Kingdom
Will not cease

There’ll be no end
To his increase

His government
Or peace

On David’s throne 
He’ll ever rule

In truth and
Righteousness

The Lord of Hosts
In all His zeal

Will soon
Accomplish this
