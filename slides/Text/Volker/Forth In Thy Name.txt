Forth In Thy Name

Forth in Thy name oh Lord I go
My daily labor to pursue

Thee only Thee resolved to know
In all I think or speak or do

The task Thy wisdom hath assigned
Oh let me cheerfully fulfill

In all my works Thy presence find
And prove Thy good and perfect will

Preserve me from my calling’s snare
And hide my simple heart above

Above the thorns of choking care
The gilded baits of worldly love

Thee may I set at my right hand
Whose eyes my inmost substance see

And labor on at Thy command
And offer all my works to Thee

Give me to bear Thy easy yoke
And every moment watch and pray

And still to things eternal look
And hasten to Thy glorious Day

For Thee
Delightfully employ

Whatever Thy bounteous
Grace hath given

And run my course with even joy
And closely walk with Thee to heaven
