Title: Lord Jesus I Love Thee.pro

Lord Jesus
I Love Thee

Lord Jesus I love Thee
I know Thou art mine

My rock and my fortress
My surety divine

My gracious redeemer
My song show be now

Tis Thou who art worthy
Lord Jesus tis Thou

I love Thee because
Thou hast first loved me

And purchased my pardon
On Calvary’s tree

I love Thee for wearing
The thorns on Thy brow

Tis Thou who art worthy
Lord Jesus tis Thou

I’ll love Thee in life
I would love Thee in death

And praise Thee as long 
As Thou lendest me breath

And sing should the death dew
Lie cold on my brow

Tis Thou who art worthy
Lord Jesus tis Thou

And when the bright morn
Of Thy glory shall come

And children ascend
To the Father’s glad home

I’ll shout with Thy likeness
Impressed on my brow

Tis Thou who art worthy
Lord Jesus tis Thou
