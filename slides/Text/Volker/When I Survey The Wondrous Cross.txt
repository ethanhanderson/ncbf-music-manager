Title: When I Survey The Wondrous Cross.pro

When I Survey
The Wondrous Cross

When I survey the
Wondrous cross

On which the
Prince of glory died

My richest gain
I count but loss

And pour contempt
On all my pride

Forbid it Lord that
I should boast

Save in the death
Of Christ my God

All the vain things that
Charm me most

I sacrifice them
To His blood

See from His head
His hands His feet

Sorrow and love
Flow mingled down

Did ever such love
And sorrow meet

Or thorns compose
So rich a crown

Were the whole realm
 Of nature mine

That were a present
Far too small

Love so amazing
So divine

Demands my soul
My life my all
