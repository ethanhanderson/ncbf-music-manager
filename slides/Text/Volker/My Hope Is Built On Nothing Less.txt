Title: My Hope Is Built On Nothing Less.pro

My Hope Is Built
On Nothing Less

My hope is built
On nothing less

Than Jesus blood
And righteousness

I dare not trust
The sweetest frame

But wholly lean
On Jesus name

On Christ the
Solid rock I stand

All other ground
Is sinking sand

All other ground
Is sinking sand

When darkness veils
His lovely face

I rest on His
Unchanging grace

In every high
And stormy gale

My anchor holds
Within the gale

His oath His covenant
And blood

Support me in
The whelming flood

When every earthly
Prop gives way

He then is all my
Hope and stay

When He shall come
With trumpet sound

Oh may I then
In Him be found

Clothed in His
Righteousness alone

Faultless to stand
Before His throne
