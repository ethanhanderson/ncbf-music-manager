I Love You Lord

I love you Lord
And I lift my voice

To worship you
Oh my soul rejoice!

Rejoice My King
In what you hear

May it be a sweet sweet sound
In your ear

I love you Lord
And I lift my voice

To worship you
Oh my soul rejoice!

Rejoice My king
In what you hear

May it be a sweet sweet sound
In your ear
