Mary Did You Know

Mary did you know
That your baby boy

Would someday
Walk on water?

Mary did you know
That your baby boy

Would save our
Sons and daughters?

Did you know that your baby boy
Has come to make you new?

This child that
You’ve delivered

Will soon
Deliver you

Mary did you know
That your baby boy

Would some day
Walk on water?

Mary did you know
That your baby boy

Would save our
Sons and daughters?

Did you know
That your baby boy

Has walked where
Angels trod

When you’ve kissed
Your little baby

Then you’ve kissed
The face of God

Mary did you know
Mary did you know

The blind will see
The deaf will hear

The dead will
Live again

The lame will leap
The dumb will speak

The praises
Of the Lamb

Mary did you know
That your baby boy

Is Lord of
All creation?

Mary did you know
That your baby boy

Will one day
Rule the nations?

Did you know that
Your baby boy

Was heaven’s
Perfect lamb?

This sleeping child
You’re holding

Is the great
I am
