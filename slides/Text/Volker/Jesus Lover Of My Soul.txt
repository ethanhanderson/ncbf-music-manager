Jesus Lover
Of My Soul

Jesus lover of my soul
Let me to thy bosom fly

While the nearer waters roll
While the tempest still is high!

Hide me oh my Savior hide
Till the storm of life is past

Safe into the haven guide
O receive my soul at last!

Other refuge have I none
Hangs my helpless soul on Thee

Leave ah leave me not alone
Still support and comfort me!

All my trust on Thee is stayed
All my help from Thee I bring

Cover my defenseless head
With the shadow of Thy wing

Thou oh Christ art all I want
More that all in Thee I find

Raise the fallen cheer the faint
Heal the sick and lead the blind

Just and holy is Thy name
I am all unrighteousness

False and full of sin I am
Thou are full of truth and grace

Plenteous grace with Thee is found
Grace to cover all my sin

Let the healing streams abound,
Make and keep me pure within

More that all in Thee I find
Raise the fallen cheer the faint

Heal the sick and lead the blind
Thou of life the fountain art

Freely let me take of Thee
Spring Thou up within my heart

Rise to
All eternity
