Mary’s Boy Child

Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible says

Mary’s Boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

Hark now hear the angels sing
New king is born today

And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

While shepherds watched
Their flocks by night

They saw a bright new shining star
And heard a choir from heaven sing

The music came
From afar

Hark now hear the angels sing
New King is born today

And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

Now Joseph and his wife Mary
Came to Bethlehem that night

They found no place to bear her child
Not a single room was in sight

By and by they found a little nook
In a stable all forlorn

And in a manger cold and dark
Mary’s little boy child was born

Trumpets sound and angels sing
Listen to what they say

That Man will live forever more
Because of Christmas Day!

Because of Christmas Day!
