He Hideth My Soul

A wonderful Savior
Is Jesus my Lord

A wonderful
Savior to me

He hideth my soul
In the cleft of the rock

Where rivers of pleasure
I see

He hideth my soul
In the cleft of the rock

That shadows a dry
Thirsty land

He hideth my life
In the depths of His love

And covers me there with His hand
And covers me there with His hand

A wonderful Savior
Is Jesus my Lord!

He taketh my
Burden away

He holdeth me up
And I shall not be moved

He giveth me strength
As my day

He hideth my soul
In the cleft of the rock

That shadows a dry
Thirsty land

He hideth my life
In the depths of His love

And covers me there with His hand
And covers me there with His hand

With numberless blessings
Each moment He crowns

And filled with
His fullness divine

I sing in my rapture
Oh glory to God

For such a
Redeemer as mine!

He hideth my soul
In the cleft of the rock

That shadows a
Dry thirsty land

He hideth my life
In the depths of His love

And covers me there with His hand
And covers me there with His hand

When clothed in His brightness
Transported I rise

To meet Him in clouds
Of the sky

His perfect salvation
His wonderful love

I’ll shout with the millions
On high

He hideth my soul
In the cleft of the rock

That shadows a
Dry thirsty land

He hideth my life
In the depths of His love

And covers me there with His hand
And covers me there with His hand
