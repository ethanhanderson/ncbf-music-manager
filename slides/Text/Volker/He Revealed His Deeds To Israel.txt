Title: He Revealed His Deeds To Israel.pro

He Revealed His
Deeds To Isreal

He revealed His
Deeds to Isreal

And made Moses
Know His path

Lord of grace
And full of pity

Rich in love and
Slow to wrath!

He will not
Continue striving

Nor be angry
Constantly

Has not dealt
With us as

Sinners punishing
Iniquity

For as high as
Are the heavens

Far above the
Earth below

Just as great to
Those who fear Him

Is the steadfast
Love He’ll show

Far as east from
West is distant

He has put
Away our sin

Like the pity
Of a father

Has the Lord’s
Compassion been
