Title: Praise the Lord Halleluah.pro

Praise The Lord
Hallelujah

Praise the Lord hallelujah!
Sing the Lord a new song!

Sing with fresh thanksgiving
Where saints gather as one

May the thought of his Maker
Joy to Israel bring

Let the sons of Zion
Take delight in their King

In exuberant dancing
Let them worship His name

Tambourine and harp join
Help them sing of His fame

For the Lord in His people
Finds great joy and delight

He adorns the humble
Saving them by His might
