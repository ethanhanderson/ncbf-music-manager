The Easter Song

Hear the bells ringing
They’re singing that you

Can be born again!
Hear the bells ringing

They’re singing
Christ is risen from the dead!

The angel upon
The tombstone

Said He has risen
Just as He said

Quickly now go
Tell His disciples

That Jesus Christ
Is no longer dead!

Joy to the world!
He is risen hallelujah!

He is risen hallelujah!
Hallelujah!

Hear the bells ringing,
They’re singing that you

Can be born again!
Hear the bells ringing

They’re singing,
Christ is risen from the dead!

The angel upon
The tombstone

Said He has risen
Just as He said

Quickly now go
Tell His disciples

That Jesus Christ
Is no longer dead!

Joy to the world!
He is risen hallelujah!

He is risen hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
