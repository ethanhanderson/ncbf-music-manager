Amazing Grace

Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me!

I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see

Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved

How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

My chains are gone I’ve been set free
My God my savior has ransomed me

And like a flood his mercy reigns
Unending love amazing grace

The Lord has promised good to me
His word my hope secures

He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures

My chains are gone I’ve been set free
My God my savior has ransomed me

And like a flood his mercy reigns.
Unending love amazing grace

My chains are gone I’ve been set free
My God my savior has ransomed me

And like a flood his mercy reigns
Unending love amazing grace

The earth shall soon dissolve like snow
The sun forbear to shine

But God, who called me here below
Will be forever mine

Will be forever mine
Will be forever mine

Will be
Forever mine
