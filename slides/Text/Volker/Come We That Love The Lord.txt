Title: Come We That Love The Lord.pro

Come We That
Love The Lord

Come we that love the Lord
And let our joys be known

Join in a song with sweet accord
And thus surround the throne

And thus surround
The throne

Let those refuse to sing
That never knew our God

But children of the heavenly king
May speak their joys abroad

May speak their
Joys abroad

The men of grace have found
Glory begun below

Celestial fruits on earthly ground
From faith and hope may grow

From faith and
Hope may grow

The hill of Zion yields
A thousand sacred sweets

Before we reach the heavenly fields
Or walk the golden streets

Or walk the
Golden streets

Then let our songs abound
And every tear be dry

We’re marching through
Immanuel’s ground

To fairer worlds on high
To fairer worlds on high
