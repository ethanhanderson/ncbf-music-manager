Title: Worship Christ The Risen King.pro

Worship Christ
The Risen King!

Rise oh church and
Lift your voices

Christ has conquered
Death and hell

Sing as all the
Earth rejoices

Resurrection
Anthems swell

Come and worship
Come and worship

Worship Christ
The risen king

See the tomb where
Death had laid him

Empty now
Its mouth declares

Death and I could
Not contain him

For the throne of
Life he shares

Come and worship
Come and worship

Worship Christ
The risen king

Hear the earth
Protest and tremble

See the stone
Removed with power

All hell’s minions
May assemble

But cannot 
Withstand His hour

He has conquered
He has conquered

Christ the Lord
The risen king

Doubt may lift its
Head to murmur

Scoffers mock
And sinners jeer

But the truth
Proclaims a wonder

Thoughtful hearts 
Receive with cheer

He is risen
He is risen

Now receive
The risen king

We acclaim your
Life oh Jesus

Now we sing
Your victory

Sin or hell may
Seek to seize us

But your conquest
Keeps us free

Stand in triumph
Stand in triumph

Worship Christ
The risen king
