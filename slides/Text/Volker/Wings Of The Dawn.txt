Wings Of The Dawn

Where can I
Run from you?

If I take the wings
Of the dawn

You’d still
Find me!

You have
Searched me

And known my
Thoughts from afar

Behind and before
You’ve enclosed

Your hand
Around me

You formed me in
My mother’s womb

And my heart
Knows it well

Without your life in me
I’d surely fail

Where can I 
Run from you?

If I take the wings
Of the dawn

You’d still
Find me!

You have
Searched me

And known my
Thoughts from afar

Behind and before
You’ve enclosed

Your hand
Around me

You formed me in
My mother’s womb

And my heart
Knows it well

Without your life in me
I’d surely fail

You formed me in
My mother’s womb

And my heart
Knows it well

Without your life in me
I’d surely fail
