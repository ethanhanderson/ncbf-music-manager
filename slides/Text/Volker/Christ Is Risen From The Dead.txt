Title: Christ Is Risen From The Dead.pro

Christ Is Risen
From The Dead

Christ is risen
From the dead

Glorious day
We celebrate

Death has no
Power over him

Hallelujah!
He is risen!

As in Adam
All men die

So all those in
Christ shall live

He has conquered
Death and hell

Hallelujah!
He is risen!

No more need
We fear the grave

Now oh death
Where is your sting?

God gives us
The victory

Hallelujah!
He is risen!

Christ is risen
From the dead

Glorious day
We celebrate

Now we live through
Faith in Him

Hallelujah!
He is risen!
