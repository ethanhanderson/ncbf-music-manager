Title: Behold The Lamb.pro

Behold The Lamb

Behold the Lamb who
Bears our sins away

Slain for us
And we remember

The promise made that
All who come in faith
Find forgiveness at the cross

So we share in this bread of life
And we drink of His sacrifice

As a sign of our bonds of peace
Around the table of the King

The body of our Savior Jesus Christ
Torn for you eat and remember

The wounds that heal
The death that brings us life
Paid the price to make us one

So we share in this bread of life
And we drink of His sacrifice

As a sign of our bonds of love
Around the table of the King

The blood that cleanses
Every stain of sin

Shed for you
Drink and remember

He drained death’s cup
That all may enter in
To receive the Life of God

So we share in this bread of life
And we drink of His sacrifice

As a sign of our bonds of grace
Around the table of the King

And so with thankfulness
And faith we rise

To respond
And to remember

Our call to follow in the  steps of Christ
As His body here on earth

As we share in His suffering
We proclaim Christ will come again

And we’ll join in the feast of heaven
Around the table of the King

Around the table of the King
