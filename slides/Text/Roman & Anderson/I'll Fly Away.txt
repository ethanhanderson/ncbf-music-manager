Title: Some bright morning when this life is over

I’ll Fly Away

Some bright morning
When this life is over

I'll fly
Away

To a home on
God's celestial shore

I'll fly
Away

I'll fly away oh glory
I'll fly away

   When I die hallelujah by and by
   I'll fly away

When the shadows
Of this life have gone

I'll fly
Away

Like a bird from 
This body I will fly

I'll fly
Away

I'll fly away oh glory
I'll fly away

   When I die hallelujah by and by
   I'll fly away

To my heavenly
Father I will flee

I'll fly
Away

Oh how glad and
Happy when we meet

I'll fly
Away

Just a few more
Weary days and then

I'll fly
Away

To a land where
Joys will never end

I'll fly
Away

I'll fly away oh glory
I'll fly away

   When I die hallelujah by and by
   I'll fly away

I’ll fly
Away
