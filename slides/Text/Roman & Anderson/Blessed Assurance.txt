Title: Blessed Assurance

Blessed Assurance

Blessed assurance
Jesus is mine

Oh what a foretaste
Of glory divine

Heir of salvation 
Purchase of God

Born of His Spirit
Washed in His blood

This is my story
This is my song

Praising my Savior
All the day long

This is my story
This is my song

Praising my Savior
All the day long

Perfect submission
Perfect delight

Visions of rapture now 
Burst on my sight

Angels descending
Bring from above

Echoes of mercy
Whispers of love

Perfect submission
All is at rest

I in my Savior
Am happy and blest

Watching and waiting
Looking above

Filled with His goodness
Lost in His love
