Title: Good And Gracious King

Good And Gracious King

I approach the throne of glory
Nothing in my hands I bring

But the promise of acceptance
From a good and gracious King

I will give to You my burden
As You give to me Your strength

You have given me your Spirit 
So I sing to You this praise

You alone have all the glory 
Overcome I lift my voice

You’re the King in need of nothing 
Empty handed I rejoice

You alone have all the glory 
Overcome with joy I sing

Through your Son I am accepted 
You’re a good and gracious King

Oh what grace that You would see me
As Your child and as Your friend

Safe secure in You forever
I pour out my praise again
