Title: Let the Nations Be Glad – Ps 67:1-7

Let the Nations Be Glad

Let the glory of the Lord
Forever be a joy

May redemption be the
Theme of our song

For by grace we have
Been saved

And by grace we
Shall proclaim

To the corners of the 
Earth that Christ has come

Let the nations be glad 
Let the people rejoice

For salvation belongs
To our God

Let the whole earth be filled 
With the praises of the Lord

For salvation belongs
To our God

Let the nations be glad

Through the ages gone before
Through the trial and the sword

Many saints and martyrs
Conquered though they died

Still we're holding out the cross
Crossing ocean suffering loss

Shall endure all things to
Win the crown of life

As your holy church goes forth
In the Holy Spirit’s power

With the glories of the
Gospel to explain

Now we pray Your kingdom come
And we pray Your will be done

For the honor and the
Glory of Your name
