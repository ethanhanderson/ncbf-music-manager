Title: The Lord Is My Salvation.pro

The Lord Is
My Salvation

The grace of God 
Has reached for me

And pulled me
From the raging sea

And I am safe on
This solid ground

The Lord is
My salvation

I will not fear
When darkness falls

His strength will help
Me scale these walls

I’ll see the dawn
Of the rising sun

The Lord is 
My salvation

Who is like the
Lord our God

Strong to save
Faithful in love

My debt is paid and the
Victory won

The Lord is
My salvation

My hope is hidden
In the Lord

He flowers each promise
Of His Word

When winter fades
I know spring will come

The Lord is
My salvation

In times of waiting
Times of need

When I know loss
When I am weak

I know His grace
Will renew these days

The Lord is
My salvation

And when I reach
My final day

He will not leave
Me in the grave

But I will rise
He will call me home

The Lord is
My salvation

Glory be to God the Father
Glory be to God the Son

Glory be to God the Spirit
The Lord is our salvation

The Lord is
Our salvation
