Title: Our Great God

Our Great God

Eternal God unchanging
Mysterious and unknown

Your boundless love unfailing
In grace and mercy shown

Bright seraphim in endless flight
Around Your glorious throne

They raise their voices day and night
In praise to You alone

Hallelujah glory be to our great God
Hallelujah glory be to our great God

 Lord we are weak and frail
Helpless in the storm

Surround us with Your angels
Hold us in Your arms

Our cold and ruthless enemy
His pleasure is our harm

Rise up oh Lord and he will flee
Before our sovereign God

Let every creature in the sea
And every flying bird

Let every mountain
Every field and valley of the earth

Let all the moons and all the stars 
In all the universe

Sing praises to the living God
Who rules them by His word
