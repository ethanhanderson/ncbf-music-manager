Title: Because He Lives (Amen)

Because He Lives

I believe in the Son
I believe in the risen One

I believe I overcome
By the power of His blood

Amen amen
I’m alive I’m alive because He lives

Amen amen
Let my song join the one that never ends

Because He lives

I was dead in the grave
I was covered in sin and shame

I heard mercy call my name
He rolled the stone away

Amen Amen
I’m alive I’m alive

Because He lives
Amen Amen

Let my song join the
One that never ends

 Because He lives
I can face tomorrow

Because He lives
Every fear is gone

I know He holds my life
My future in His hands

Because He lives
Because He lives
