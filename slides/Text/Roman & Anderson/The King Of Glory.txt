The King Of Glory

The King of Glory Reigns
Over all the world

His mighty hand sustains
The heavens and the earth

Who may come to Him
And seek His holy face

He calls the pure in heart
All whose hands are clean

And those who love His name
Above all other things

Humbly I will bow
And Jesus’ Name confess

He reigns He reigns
Jesus the Lord

He reigns He reigns
Forevermore

Swing wide you ancient gates
Let the King come in

His glory never fades
Our hearts delight in Him

Every knee will bow
Every tongue confess
