Title: How Great Is Your Love

How Great Is Your Love

 My heart is steadfast oh God
And I will sing

With all my heart and soul
Music for the King

And I will awake the dawn
With my praise to you oh Lord

How great is your love
So much higher than the heavens

With faithfulness that
Reaches the sky

How great is your love
So much higher than the heavens

With faithfulness that
Reaches the sky

Oh how great
Is your love

 Praise the Lord oh my soul
And glory to the King

Forever You are robed
With majesty

We come to You oh Lord
Lay our praise at Your feet

Be exalted oh God and let
Your glory reign
