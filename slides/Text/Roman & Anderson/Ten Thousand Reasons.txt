Ten Thousand Reasons

Bless the Lord oh my Soul
Oh My Soul

Worship His holy name
Sing like never before

Oh my soul
I’ll worship Your holy name

The sun comes up
It’s a new day dawning

It’s time to sing 
Your song again

Whatever may pass
And whatever lies before me

Let me be singing
When the evening comes

You’re rich in love
And Your slow to anger

Your name is great
And Your heart is kind

For all Your goodness
I will keep on singing

Ten thousand reasons
for my heart to find

And on that day
When my strength is failing

The end draws near
And my time has come

Still my soul will sing
Your praise unending

Ten thousand years
And then forever more!

I’ll worship Your holy name
Yes I’ll worship Your holy name
