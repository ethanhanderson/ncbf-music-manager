Title: Verse 1

It was finished
upon the cross

How I love the words of Jesus
On the cross of Calvary

He declared His work is finished
He had won the victory

The wages of my sin condemned me
And all earthly hope was lost

Christ had triumphed over evil
It was finished upon the cross

Now the curse it has been broken
Jesus paid the price for me

Full the pardon he has purchased
Great the welcome that I receive

 Boldly I approach my Father
Clothеd in Jesus' righteousness

Thеre is no more guilt to carry
It was finished upon the cross

Death was once my great opponent
Fear once had a hold on me

But the Son who died to save us
Rose that we would be free indeed

 Free from every plan of darkness
Free to live and free to love

Death is dead and Christ is risen
It was finished upon the cross

Onward to eternal glory
To my Savior and my God

I rejoice in Jesus' victory
It was finished upon the cross

It was finished upon the cross
It was finished upon the cross
