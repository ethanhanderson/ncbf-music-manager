Title: Only a Holy God

Only a Holy God

Who else commands
All the hosts of heaven

Who else could make
Every king bow down

Who else can whisper 
And darkness trembles

Only a Holy God

What other beauty
Demands such praises

What other splendor
Outshines the sun

What other majesty
Rules with justice

Only a Holy God

Come and behold Him
The one and the only

Cry out sing holy
Forever a holy God

Come and worship
The holy God

What other glory
Consumes like fire

What other power
Can raise the dead

What other name
Remains undefeated

Only a Holy God

Who else could rescue
Me from my failing

Who else would
Offer His only Son

Who else invites me
To call Him father

Only a holy God
Only my holy God

Come and worship
The holy God
