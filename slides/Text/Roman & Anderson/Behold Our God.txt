Title: Behold Our God.pro

Behold Our God

Who has held the oceans in His hand
Who has numbered every grain of sand

Kings and nations tremble at His voice
All creation rises to rejoice

Behold our God seated on His throne
Come let us adore Him

Behold our King nothing can compare
Come let us adore Him

Who has given counsel to the Lord
Who can question any of His words

Who can teach the one who knows all things
Who can fathom all his wondrous deeds

Behold our God seated on His throne
Come let us adore Him

Behold our King nothing can compare
Come let us adore Him

Who has felt the nails upon His hands
Bearing all the guilt of sinful man

God eternal humbled to the grave
Jesus Savior risen now to reign

Behold our God seated on His throne
Come let us adore Him

Behold our King nothing can compare
Come let us adore Him

You will reign forever
(Let Your glory fill the earth)

You will reign forever
(Let Your glory fill the earth)

You will reign forever
(Let Your glory fill the earth)

You will reign forever
(Let Your glory fill the earth)

Behold our God seated on His throne
Come let us adore Him

Behold our King nothing can compare
Come let us adore Him
