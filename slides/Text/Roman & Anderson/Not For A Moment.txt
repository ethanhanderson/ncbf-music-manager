Title: Not For a Moment (After All)

Not For a Moment

You were reaching
Through the storm

Walking on the water
Even when I could not see

In the middle
Of it all

When I thought You were
A thousand miles away

Not for a moment
Did You forsake me

Not for a moment
Did You forsake me

After all
You are constant

After all
You are only good

After all
You are Sovereign

Not for a moment
Will You forsake me

Not for a moment
Will You forsake me

You were singing
In the dark

Whispering Your promise
Even when I could not hear

I was held in
Your arms

Carried for a thousand
Miles to show

Not for a moment
Did You forsake me

Not for a moment
Did You forsake me

After all
You are constant

After all
You are only good

After all
You are Sovereign

Not for a moment
Will You forsake me

Not for a moment
Will You forsake me

Every step every breath
You are there

Every tear every cry
Every prayer

In my hurt in my worst
When my world falls down

Not for a moment
Will You forsake me

Not for a moment
Will You forsake me

After all
You are constant

After all
You are only good

After all
You are Sovereign

Not for a moment
Will You forsake me

Not for a moment
Will You forsake me

Not for a moment
Will You forsake me
