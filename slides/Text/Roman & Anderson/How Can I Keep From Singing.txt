Title: How Can I Keep From Singing

How Can I Keep From Singing

There is an endless song
echoes within my soul

I hear the music ring
And though the storms may come

I am holding on
To the rock I cling

How can I keep from
Singing Your praise

How can I ever say enough
How amazing is Your love

How can I keep from
Shouting Your Name

I know I am loved by the King
And it makes my heart want to sing

I will lift my eyes in the darkest night
For I know my Saviour lives

And I will walk with You
Knowing You’ll see me through

And sing the
Songs You give

I can sing in the troubled times
Sing when I win

I can sing when I lose my step
And fall down again

I can sing ‘cause You pick me up
Sing ‘cause You’re there

I can sing ‘cause You hear me Lord
When I call to You in prayer

I can sing with my last breath
Sing for I know

That I’ll sing with the angels 
And the saints around the throne
