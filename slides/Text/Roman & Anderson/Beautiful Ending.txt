Title: Beautiful Ending

Beautiful Ending

 Oh tragedy
Has taken so many

Hope lost cause they all
Denied who You are

And it scares me to think
That I would choose

My life over You
My selfish heart

Divides me from You
It tears me apart

So tell me
What is our ending?

Will it be beautiful
So beautiful?

 Oh why do I
Let myself let go

Of hands that painted the stars
And hold tears that fall?

And the pride of my heart
Makes me forget

It's not me but You
Who makes the heart beat

I'm lost without You
And dying from me

 So tell me
What is our ending?

Will it be beautiful
So beautiful?

Will my life
Find me by Your side?

Your love is beautiful
So beautiful

At the end of it all
I wanna be in Your arms

 At the end of it all
I wanna be in Your arms

 At the end of it all
I wanna be in Your arms

So tell me
What is our ending?

Will it be beautiful
So beautiful?

Yes my life
Will find me by Your side

Your love is beautiful
So beautiful
