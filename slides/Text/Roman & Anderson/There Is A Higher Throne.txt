Title: There is a Higher Throne

There is a Higher Throne

There is a higher throne
Than all this world has known

Where faithful ones from every tongue
Will one day come

Before the son we’ll stand
Made faultless through the Lamb

Believing hearts find promised grace
Salvation comes

Hear heaven’s voices sing
Their thunderous anthem rings

Through emerald courts
And sapphire skies
Their praises rise

All glory wisdom power
Strength thanks and honor are

To God our King who reigns on high
Forevermore

And there we’ll find our home
Our life before the throne

We’ll honor Him in perfect song
Where we belong

He’ll wipe each tear stained eye
As thirst and hunger die

The Lamb becomes our shepherd king
We’ll reign with Him
