Title:  All Praise To HimAll praise to Him, the God of light

All Praise To Him

All praise to Him the God of light
Who formed the mountains By His might

All praise to Him who names the stars
That sing His fame in skies afar

All praise to Him who reigns in love
Who guides the galaxies above

Yet bends to hear our every prayer
With sovereign power and tender care

All praise to Him whose love is seen
In Christ the Son the Servant King

Who left behind His glorious throne
To pay the ransom for His own

 All praise to Him who humbly came
To bear our sorrow sin and shame

Who lived to die who died to rise
The all-sufficient sacrifice

All praise to Him whose power imparts
The love of God within our hearts

The Spirit of all truth and peace
The fount of joy and holiness

 To Father Son and Spirit now
Our souls we lift our wills we bow

To You the Triune God we raise
With loving hearts our song of praise

 To Father Son and Spirit now
Our souls we lift our wills we bow

To You the Triune God we raise
With loving hearts our song of praise
