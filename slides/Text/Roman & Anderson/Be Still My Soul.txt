Title: Be Still My Soul

Be Still My Soul

Be still my soul
The Lord is on thy side

Bear patiently
The cross of grief or pain

Leave to thy God
To order and provide

In every change
He faithful will remain

Be still my soul
Thy best thy heavenly Friend

Through thorny ways
Leads to a joyful end

Be still my soul
Thy God doth undertake

To guide the future
As He has the past

Thy hope thy confidence
Let nothing shake

All now mysterious
Shall be bright at last

Be still my soul
The waves and winds still know

His voice who ruled them
While He dwelt below

Be still my soul
Though dearest friends depart

And all is darkened
In the vale of tears

Then shalt thou better
Know His love His heart

Who comes to soothe
Thy sorrows and thy fears

Be still my soul
Thy Jesus can repay

From His own fullness
All He takes away

Be still my soul
The hour is hastening on

When we shall be
Forever with the Lord

When disappointment grief
And fear are gone

Sorrow forgot
Love's purest joys restored

Be still my soul
When change and tears are past

All safe and blessed
We shall meet at last
