Title: Lord From Sorrows Deep I Call

Lord From Sorrows
Deep I Call

Lord from sorrows deep I call
When my hope is shaken

Torn and ruined from the fall
Hear my desperation

For so long I've pled and prayed
God come to my rescue

Even so the thorn remains
Help my heart to praise You

Storms within my troubled soul
Questions without answers

On my faith these billows roll
God be now my shelter

Why are you cast down my soul
Hope in Him who saves you

When the fires have all grown cold
Cause this heart to praise You

Oh my soul put your hope in God
My help my rock I will praise Him

Sing oh sing through the raging storm
You're still my God my salvation

Should my life be torn from me
Every worldly pleasure

When all I possess is grief
God be then my treasure

Be my vision in the night
Be my hope and refuge

Til my faith is turned to sight
Lord my heart will praise You
