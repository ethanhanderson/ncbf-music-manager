Title: Great is Thy faithfulness, O God, my Father;

Great is Thy faithfulness

Great is Thy faithfulness
Oh God my Father

There is no shadow of
Turning with Thee

Thou changest not
Thy compassions they fail not

As Thou hast been
Thou forever will be

Summer and winter
And springtime and harvest

Sun moon and stars
In their courses above

Join with all nature in
Manifold witness

To Thy great faithfulness
Mercy and love

Great is Thy faithfulness
Great is Thy faithfulness

Morning by morning
New mercies I see

All I have needed
Thy hand hath provided

Great is Thy faithfulness
Lord unto me

Pardon for sin and a
Peace that endureth

Thy own dear presence to
Cheer and to guide

Strength for today and
Bright hope for tomorrow

Blessings all mine
With ten thousand beside
