Title: Because He Lives.pro

Because He Lives

God sent His son
They called Him Jesus

He came to love
Heal and forgive

He lived and died
To buy my pardon

An empty grave is there
To prove my Savior lives

Because He lives 
I can face tomorrow

Because He lives
All fear is gone

Because I know 
He holds the future

And life is worth the living
Just because He lives

How sweet to hold
A newborn baby

And feel the pride
And joy he brings

But greater still
The calm assurance

This child can face uncertain
Days because He Lives

Because He lives
I can face tomorrow

Because He lives
All fear is gone

Because I know
He holds the future

And life is worth the living
Just because He lives

And then one day I’ll cross the river
I’ll fight life’s final war with pain

And then as death
Gives way to victory

I’ll see the lights of glory  and I’ll know He lives

Because He lives I can face tomorrow
Because He lives all fear is gone

Because I know
He holds the future

And life is worth the living
Just because He lives
