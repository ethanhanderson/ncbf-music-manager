Title: You Laid Aside Your Majesty

You Laid Aside Your Majesty

You laid aside Your majesty
Gave up everything for me

Suffered at the hands
Of those You had created

You took all my guilt and shame
When You died and rose again

Now today You reign
And heaven and earth exalt You

I really want to worship You my Lord
You have changed my heart and I am Yours

Forever and ever I will love You
You are the only one who died for me

Gave Your life to set me free
So I lift my voice to You in adoration
