Title: Amazing Grace

Amazing Grace

Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me!

I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see

Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved

How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed!

Through many dangers toils and snares
I have already come

Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home

The Lord has promised good to me
His Word my hope secures

He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures

And when this flesh and heart shall fail
And mortal life shall cease

I shall possess within the veil
A life of joy and peace

 When we've been there
Ten thousand years

Bright shining
As the sun

We’ve no less days
To sing God’s praise

Than when
We first begun

We've no less days
To sing God's praise

Than when
We first begun
