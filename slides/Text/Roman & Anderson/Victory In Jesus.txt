Title: I heard an old, old story, how a Savior came from glory,

Victory In Jesus

I heard an old, old story
How a Savior came from glory

How He gave His life on Calvary
To save a wretch like me

I heard about His groaning
Of His precious blood atoning

Then I repented of my sin
And won the victory

O victory in Jesus
My Savior forever!

He sought me and bought me
With His redeeming blood

He loved me ere I knew Him
And all my love is due Him

He plunged me to victory
Beneath the cleansing flood

I heard about his healing
Of His cleansing power revealing

How He made the lame to walk
Again and caused the blind to see

And then I cried dear Jesus
come and heal my broken spirit

And somehow Jesus came
And brought to me the victory

O victory in Jesus
My Savior forever!

He sought me and bought me
With His redeeming blood

He loved me ere I knew Him
And all my love is due Him

He plunged me to victory
Beneath the cleansing flood

 I heard about a mansion
He has built for me in glory

And I heard about the streets of gold
Beyond the crystal sea

About the angels singing
And the old redemption story

And some sweet day I’ll sing
Up there the song of victory

O victory in Jesus
My Savior forever!

He sought me and bought me
With His redeeming blood

He loved me ere I knew Him
And all my love is due Him

He plunged me to victory
Beneath the cleansing flood
