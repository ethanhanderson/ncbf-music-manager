Title: It Is Well With My Soul

It Is Well With My Soul

 When peace like a river
Attendeth my way

When sorrows like
Sea billows roll

Whatever my lot
Thou hast taught me to say

It is well it is well
With my soul

It is well

(It is well)

With my soul

(With my soul)

  It is well it is well
With my soul

 Though Satan should buffet
Though trials should come

Let this blest
Assurance control

That Christ hath regarded
My helpless estate

And hath shed His
Own blood for my soul

My sin oh the bliss of 
This glorious thought!

My sin not in part
But the whole

Is nailed to His cross
And I bear it no more

Praise the Lord 
Praise the Lord oh my soul!

And Lord haste the day
When my faith shall be sight

The clouds be rolled back
As a scroll

The trump shall resound
And the Lord shall descend

Even so it is well
With my soul
