Title: Christ Is Risen He Is Risen Indeed.pro

Christ Is Risen   He Is Risen Indeed

How can it be?
The One who died

Has borne our sin
Through sacrifice

To conquer every sting of death
Sing sing hallelujah

For joy awakes
As dawning light

When Christ's disciples
Lift their eyes

Alive He stands their
Friend & King

Christ christ
He is risen

Christ is risen
He is risen indeed

Oh sing
Hallelujah

Join the chorus
Sing with the redeemed

Christ is risen
He is risen indeed

Where doubt and darkness  Once had been

They saw Him and
Their hearts believed

But blessed are those
Who have not seen

Yet sing
Hallelujah

Once bound by fear
Now bold in faith

They preached the truth  And power of grace

And pouring out
Their lives they

Gained life
Life everlasting

The power that raised Him  From the grave

Now works in us
To powerfully save

He frees our hearts
To live His grace

Go tell of
His goodness

He is risen! He's alive!
He's alive!

Heaven's gates are
Opened wide!

He's alive! He's alive!
Now in heaven glorified!

He's alive! He's alive!
Heaven's gates are opened wide!

He's alive! He's alive!
Now in heaven glorified!
