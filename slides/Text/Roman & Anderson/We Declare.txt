Title: We Declare

We Declare

We are his kingdom we are his bride
For us he paid the price

For us he bled and died
We are his people his treasured prize

For us he conquered sin
For he is risen

So we declare the praises
Of Jesus Saviour and King

He is the cornerstone Hallelujah
And now we stand as his church

Until the day when he comes in glory Hallelujah

We are a priesthood beloved ones
He draws the scattered near

He builds his kingdom here
A holy nation now set apart

To be his hands and feet
To speak his mercy

With thankfulness we will sing
Adopted now we are his
