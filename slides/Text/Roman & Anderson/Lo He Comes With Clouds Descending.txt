Title: Lo! He comes with clouds descending,

Lo He Comes With
Clouds Descending

Lo He comes with clouds descending
Once for favored sinners slain

Thousand thousand saints attending
Swell the triumph of His train

Hallelujah hallelujah
God appears on earth to reign

 Now redemption long expected
See in solemn pomp appear

All His saints by man rejected
Now shall meet Him in the air

Hallelujah hallelujah
See the day of God appear

 Yea Amen let all adore Thee
High on Thine eternal throne

Savior take the power and glory
Claim the kingdom for Thine own

Oh come quickly oh come quickly
Everlasting God come down
