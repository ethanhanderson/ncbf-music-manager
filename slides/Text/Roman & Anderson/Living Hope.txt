Title: Living Hope

Living Hope

How great the chasm
That lay between us

How high the mountain
I could not climb

In desperation
I turned to heaven

And spoke Your name
Into the night

 Then through the darkness
Your loving kindness

Tore through the
Shadows of my soul

The work is finished
The end is written

Jesus Christ
My living hope

Hallelujah praise the
One who set me free

Hallelujah death has 
Lost its grip on me

You have broken every chain
There’s salvation in Your name

Jesus Christ 
My living hope

Who could imagine
So great a mercy

What heart could fathom
Such boundless grace

The God of angels
Stepped down from glory

To wear my sin 
And bear my shame

The cross has spoken
I am forgiven

The King of kings
Calls me His own

Beautiful savior
I’m Yours forever

Jesus Christ
My living hope

Then came the morning
That sealed the promise

Your buried body
Began to breathe

Out of the silence
The roaring Lion

Declared the grave
Has no claim on me

Jesus Yours
Is the victory

Jesus Christ 
My living hope
