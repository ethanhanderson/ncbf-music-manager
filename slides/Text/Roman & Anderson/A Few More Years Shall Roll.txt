Title: A Few More Years Shall Roll

A Few More Years Shall Roll

A few more years shall roll
A few more seasons come

And we will all be with the Lord
In our eternal home

Then O my Lord prepare 
My soul for that blest day

O wash me in your precious blood
And take my sins away

A few more suns shall set
O’er these dark hills of time 

And we shall be where suns are not
A far serener clime

A few more storms shall beat 
On this wild rocky shore

And we shall be where tempests cease
And surges swell no more

A few more struggles here
A few more partings o'er

A few more toils a few more tears 
And we shall weep no more

'Tis but a little while 
And he shall come again

Who died that we might live with him
Who lives that we might reign
