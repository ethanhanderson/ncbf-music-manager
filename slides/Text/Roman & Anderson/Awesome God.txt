Awesome God

When he rolls up his sleeves
He ain't just puttin' on the ritz

Our God is an
Awesome God!

There is thunder in His footsteps
And lightning in His fists

Our God is an
Awesome God!

 The Lord wasn't joking when
He kicked 'em out of Eden

It wasn't for no reason
That He shed His blood

His return is very certain
So you better be believin' that

Our God is an
Awesome God!

 And when the sky was starless
In the void of the night

Our God is an
Awesome God!

He spoke into the darkness
And created the light

Our God is an
Awesome God!

Judgment and wrath
He poured out on Sodom

Mercy and grace He 
Gave us at the Cross

I hope that we have not
Too quickly forgotten

That our God is an
Awesome God!

Our God is an awesome God
​He reigns from heaven above

​With wisdom power and love
​Our God is an awesome God!

​Our God is an
Awesome God!
