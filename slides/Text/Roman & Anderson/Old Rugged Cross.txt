Title: Old Rugged Cross

Old rugged cross

 On a hill far away
Stood an old rugged cross

The emblem of
Suffering and shame

And I love that old cross
Where the dearest and best

For a world of lost
Sinners was slain

So I'll cherish the
Old rugged Cross

Till my trophies
At last I lay down

I will cling to the
Old rugged Cross

And exchange it some
Day for a crown

 Oh that old rugged Cross
So despised by the world

Has a wondrous
Attraction for me

For the dear Lamb of God
Left his Glory above

To bear it to
Dark Calvary

In the old rugged Cross
Stained with blood so divine

A wondrous
Beauty I see

For the dear Lamb of God
Left his Glory above

To pardon and
Sanctify me

To the old rugged Cross
I will ever be true

Its shame and reproach
Gladly bear

Then He'll call me some day
To my home far away

Where his glory
Forever I'll share
