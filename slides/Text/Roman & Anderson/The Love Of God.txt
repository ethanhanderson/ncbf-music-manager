Title: The Love Of God

The Love Of God

The love of God is greater far
Than tongue or pen can ever tell

It goes beyond the highest star
And reaches to the lowest hell

The guilty heir bowed down with care
God gave His son to win

This erring child He reconciled
And pardoned from his sin

Could we with ink the ocean fill
And were the skies of parchment made

Were every stalk on earth a quill
And every man a scribe by trade

To write the love of God above
Would drain the ocean dry

Nor could the scroll contain the whole
Though stretched from sky to sky

Hallelujah hallelujah
Hallelujah!

Oh love of God how rich and pure!
How measureless and strong!

It shall forever more endure
The saints' and angels' song
