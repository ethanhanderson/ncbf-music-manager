Title: Verse 1

Creation Awaits

I am alive
Saved by your sacrifice

Death overcome
Your glory dispels the night

You call the lifeless to wake
From death to life

Out of darkness arise

You set me free
Saved from the power of sin

Guilt overcome
Your Spirit at work within

You break the chains of the law
I am released

From the burden of sin

Now we cry Father
We are your children

We are adopted
As your own      

No condemnation
We are forgiven

Nothing can take us
From your love

I am redeemed
Raised with my Savior Christ

Fear overcome
You be glorified

You will forever defend
And stand beside

I am safe in your love

Creation awaits the glorious day
When Jesus returns and trials will fade
