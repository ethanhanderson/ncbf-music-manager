Title: I Waited for the Lord My God 

I Waited for the Lord My God 

I waited for the Lord my God
And patiently did bear

At length to me He did incline
My voice and cry to hear

And took me from a fearful pit
And from the miry clay

And on a rock He set my feet
Establishing my way

He put a new song in my mouth
Our God to magnify

Many shall see it and shall fear
And on the Lord rely

O blessed is the man whose trust 
Upon the Lord relies

Respecting not the proud nor such 
As turning aside to lies

O Lord my God how gracious are 
The things that you have done

You sought us out when we were lost 
And gave your only Son 

May all who seek you find your help
And kind deliverance

In these last days fulfilled in Christ 
In His new covenant
