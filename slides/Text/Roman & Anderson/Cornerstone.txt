Title: Cornerstone

Cornerstone

My hope is built
On nothing less

Than Jesus blood
And righteousness

I dare not trust
The sweetest frame

But wholly trust
In Jesus name

Christ alone
Cornerstone

Weak made strong
In the Savior's love

Through the storm He is Lord
Lord of all

When darkness seems
To hide His face

I rest on His
Unchanging grace

In every high
And stormy gale

My anchor holds
Within the veil

When He shall come
With trumpet sound

Oh may I then in
Him be found

Dressed in His
Righteousness alone

Faultless I stand before
The throne
