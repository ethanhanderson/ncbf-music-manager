Title: O Worship the King

Oh worship the king

Oh worship the King
All glorious above

Oh gratefully sing
His power and his love

Our shield and defender
The ancient of days

Pavilioned in splendor
And girded with praise

Oh tell of his might
And sing of his grace

Whose robe is the light
Whose canopy space

His chariots of wrath the
Deep thunderclouds form

And dark is his path on
The wings of the storm

Your bountiful care
What tongue can recite

It breathes in the air
It shines in the light

It streams from the hills
It descends to the plain

And sweetly distills in
The dew and the rain

 Frail children of dust
And feeble as frail

In you do we trust
Nor find you to fail

Your mercies how tender
How firm to the end

Our maker defender
Redeemer and friend

Oh measureless might
Unchangeable love

Whom angels delight
To worship above

Your ransomed creation
With glory ablaze

In true adoration shall
Sing to your praise
