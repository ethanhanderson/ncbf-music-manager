Title: It Came Upon A Midnight Clear

It Came Upon A Midnight Clear

It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old

From angels bending near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth good will to men
From heaven's all-gracious King

The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the angels sing

O ye beneath life's crushing load
Whose forms are bending low

Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow

Look now for glad and golden hours
Come swiftly on the wing

Oh rest beside the weary road
And hear the angels sing

They sing Alleluia they shout alleluia
Angels come to sing of the new born King

They sing Alleluia
Heaven’s come to save us God the Son is with us

Angels come to sing of the new born King
They sing Alleluia

For lo the days are hastening on
By prophets seen of old

When with the ever-circling years
Shall come the time foretold

When the new heaven and earth shall own
The Prince of Peace their King

And the whole world send back the song
Which now the angels sing
