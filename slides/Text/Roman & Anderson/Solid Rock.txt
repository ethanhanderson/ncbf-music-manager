Solid Rock

My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus blood and righteousness

I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly lean on Jesus’ name

On Christ the solid rock I stand
All other ground is sinking sand

All other ground is sinking sand

When darkness veils His lovely face
I rest on His unchanging grace

In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil

His oath His covenant His blood
Support me in the whelming flood

When all around my soul gives way
He then is all my hope and stay

When He shall come
With trumpet sound

Oh may I then
In Him be found

Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless to stand before the throne
