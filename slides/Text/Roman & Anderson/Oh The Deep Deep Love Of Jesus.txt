Title: Oh The Deep Deep Love Of Jesus

Oh The Deep Deep
Love Of Jesus

Oh the deep deep love of Jesus
Vast unmeasured boundless free

Rolling as a mighty ocean
In its fullness over me

Underneath me all around me
Is the current of Thy love

Leading onward leading homeward
To my glorious rest above

Oh the deep deep love of Jesus
Spread His praise from shore to shore

How he loveth ever loveth
Changeth never never more

How He watches over His loved ones
Died to call them all His own

How for them He intercedeth
Watcheth over them from the throne

Oh the deep deep love of Jesus
Love of every love the best

Tis an ocean vast of blessing
Tis a haven sweet of rest

Oh the deep deep love of Jesus
Tis a heaven of heavens to me

And it lifts me up to glory
For it lifts me up to Thee
