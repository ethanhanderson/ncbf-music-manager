Title: Crown Him with Many Crowns

Crown him with
many crowns

Crown Him with many crowns
The Lamb upon His throne

Hark how the heavenly anthem drowns
All music but its own

Awake my soul and sing
Of Him who died for thee

And hail Him as thy matchless King
Through all eternity

Crown Him the Lord of Love
Behold His hands and side

Rich wounds yet visible above
In beauty glorified

No angel in the sky
Can fully bear that sight

But downward bends His burning eye
And mystery so bright

Crown Him the Lord of life
Who triumphed over the grave

And rose victorious in the strife
For those He came to save

His glories now we sing
Who died and rose on high

Who died eternal life to bring
And lives that death may die

Crown Him the Lord of heaven
One with the Father known

One with the Spirit through Him given
From yonder glorious throne

All hail Redeemer hail
For Thou hast died for me

Thy praise and glory shall not fail
Through all eternity

Crown Him the Lord of years
The Potentate of time

Creator of the rolling spheres
Ineffably sublime

All hail Redeemer hail
For Thou hast died for me

Thy praise and glory shall not fail
Throughout eternity
