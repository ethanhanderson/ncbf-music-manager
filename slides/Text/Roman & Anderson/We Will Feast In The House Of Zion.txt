Title: We Will Feast In the House of Zion – Is 126; shalom-Is 26:3&Col3:15&Ep 4:3&Jn14:27;

We Will Feast In
The House Of Zion

We will feast in the house of Zion
We will sing with our hearts restored

He has done great things
We will say together

We will feast and weep no more

We will not be burned by the fire
He is the Lord our God

We are not consumed by the flood
Upheld protected gathered up

In the dark of night before the Dawn
 My soul be not afraid

For the promised morning
Oh how long

Oh God of Jacob
Be my strength

Every vow we’ve broken and betrayed
You are the faithful one

And from the garden to the grave
Bind us together bring shalom
