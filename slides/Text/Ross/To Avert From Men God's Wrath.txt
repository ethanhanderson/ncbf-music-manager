Title: To Avert From Men God's Wrath.pro

To Avert From Men
God’s Wrath

To avert from men God’s wrath
Jesus suffered in our stead

By an ignominious deathHe a full atonement made

And by His most precious bloodBrought us sinners nigh to God

That we never should forget
This great Love on us bestowed

He gave us His flesh to eat
And to drink His precious blood

All who sick and needy are
May receive in Him a share

Hither each afflicted soul May repair
Though filled with grief

To the sick not to the whole
The Physician brings relief

Fear not therefore but draw nigh
Christ will all your wants supply

But examine first your case
Whether you be in the faith

Do you long for pardoning grace?
Is your only hope His death?

Then however your soul's oppressed
Come you are a worthy guest

He who Jesus' mercy knows
Is from wrath and envy freed

Love unto our neighbor shows
That we are His flock indeed

Thus we may in all our ways
Show forth our Redeemer's praise
