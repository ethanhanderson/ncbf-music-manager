God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen 

God rest you merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay

For Jesus Christ our Savior 
Was born upon this day

To save us all from Satan’s power
When we were gone astray

​O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

From God our heavenly father
A blessed angel came

And unto certain shepherds
Brought tidings of the same

How that in Bethlehem was
Born the Son of God by name​

The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind

And left their flocks a-feeding in
Tempest storm and wind

And went to Bethlehem straightway
This blessed Babe to find

But when in Bethlehem they came to
Whereat this Infant lay

They found Him in a manger
Where oxen feed on hay

His mother Mary kneeling 
Unto the Lord did pray

Now to the Lord sing praises
All you within this place

And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace

This holy tide of Christmas 
All other doth deface ​
