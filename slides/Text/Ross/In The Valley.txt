In The Valley

When you lead me to
The valley of vision

I can see you
In the heights

And though my humbling
Wouldn’t be my decision

It’s here Your glory
Shines so bright

So let me learn that the
Cross precedes the crown

To be low is
To be high

That the valley’s where you
Make me more like Christ

Let me find your grace
In the valley

Let me find your life
In my death

Let me find your joy
In my sorrow

Your wealth
In my need

That you’re near
With every breath

In the valley

In the daytime there
Are stars in the heavens

But they only
Shine at night

And the deeper that
I go into darkness

The more I see
Their radiant light

So let me learn that
My losses are my gain

To be broken
Is to heal

That the valley’s where
Your power is revealed

Let me find your grace
In the valley

Let me find your life
In my death

Let me find your joy
In my sorrow

Your wealth
In my need

That you’re near
With every breath

In the valley
In the valley
