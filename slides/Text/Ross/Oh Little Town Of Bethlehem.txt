Title: Oh Little Town Of Bethlehem.pro

Oh Little Town
Of Bethlehem

Oh little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by

Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting light

The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above

While mortals sleep the angels keep their
Watch of wondering love

Oh morning stars together
Proclaim thy holy birth.

And praises sing to God the king
And peace to men on earth

How silently how silently
The wondrous gift is given!

So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of his heaven

No ear may hear his coming
But in this world of sin

Where meek souls will receive him
Still the dear Christ enters in

Oh holy Child of Bethlehem
Descend to us we pray

Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born in us today

We hear the Christmas angels the
Great glad tidings tell

Oh come to us abide with
Us our Lord Immanuel!
