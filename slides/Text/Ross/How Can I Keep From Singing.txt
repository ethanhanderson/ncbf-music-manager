Title: How Can I Keep From Singing.pro

How Can I Keep
From Singing

There is an endless
Song echos in my soul

I hear the music ring
And though the storms may come

I am holding on to
The Rock I cling

How can I keep from
Singing Your praise

How can I ever say enough
How amazing is Your love

How can I keep from
Shouting Your name

I know I am loved by the King
And it makes my heart want to sing

I will lift my eyes in the darkest night
For I know my Savior lives

And I will walk with You
Knowing you’ll see me through and

Sing the songs
You give

How can I keep from
Singing Your praise

How can I ever say enough
How amazing is Your love

How can I keep from
Shouting Your name

I know I am loved by the King
And it makes my heart want to sing

I can sing in the troubled times
Sing when I win

I can sing when I loose my step
And I fall down again

I can sing cause you pick me up
Sing cause you are there

I can sing cause You hear me Lord
When I call to you in prayer

I can sing with my last breath
Sing for I know

That I’ll sing with the angels
And the saints around the throne

How can I keep from
Singing Your praise

How can I ever say enough
How amazing is Your love

How can I keep from
Shouting Your name

I know I am loved by the King
And it makes my heart

I am loved by the King
And it makes my heart

I am loved by the King
And it makes my heart want to sing!
