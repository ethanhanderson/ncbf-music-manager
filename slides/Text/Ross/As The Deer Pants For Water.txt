As The Deer
Pants For Water

As the deer pants for the waterSo my soul longs after you

You alone are my heart's desireAnd I long to worship you

You alone are my strength my shieldTo you alone will my spirit yield

You alone are my hearts desireAnd I long to worship you

I love you more than gold or silverOnly you can satisfy

You alone are the real joy giverAnd the apple of my eye

You alone are my strength my shieldTo you alone will my spirit yield

You alone are my hearts desireAnd I long to worship you

You're my friend and you are my FatherEven though you are my King

I love you more than any otherSo much more than anything

You alone are my strength my shieldTo you alone will my spirit yield

You alone are my hearts desireAnd I long to worship you
