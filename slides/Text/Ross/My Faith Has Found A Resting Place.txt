Title: My Faith Has Found A Resting Place.pro

My Faith Has Found
A Resting Place

My faith has found a resting place
From guilt my soul is freed

I trust the ever living One
His wounds for me shall plead

I need no other argument
I need no other plea

It is enough that Jesus died
And that He died for me

Enough for me that Jesus saves
This ends my fear and doubt

A sinful soul I come to Him
He’ll never cast me out

My heart is leaning on the Word
The living word of God

Salvation by my Savior’s name
Salvation through His blood

My great Physician heals the sick
The lost He came to save

For me His precious blood He shed
For me His life He gave

It is enough that Jesus died
And that He died for me
