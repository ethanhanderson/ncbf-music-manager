Title: Glorious Things Of Thee Are Spoken (Austria)

Glorious Things of
Thee Are Spoken

Glorious things of thee are spoken
Zion city of our God

He whose word cannot be broken
Formed thee for His own abode

On the Rock of Ages founded
What can shake thy sure repose

With salvation's walls surrounded
Thou may'st smile at all thy foes

See the streams of living waters
Springing from eternal love

Well supply thy sons and daughters
And all fear of want remove

Who can faint while such a river
Ever flows their thirst to assuage

Grace which like the Lord the Giver
Never fails from age to age

Round each habitation hov'ring
See the cloud and fire appear

For a glory and a cov'ring
Showing that the Lord is near

Thus deriving from their banner
Light by night and shade by day

Safe they feed upon the manna
Which He gives them when they pray

Savior if of Zion's city
I through grace a member am

Let the world deride or pity
I will glory in Thy name

Fading is the worldlings pleasure
All His boasted pomp and show

Solid joys and lasting treasures
None but Zion's children know

Solid joys and lasting treasures
None but Zion's children know
