Title: Come Thou Long Expected Jesus.pro

Come Thou
Long Expected Jesus

Come thou long expected Jesus
Born to set Thy people free

From our fears and sins release us
Let us find our rest in Thee

Come our strength and consolation
Hope of all the earth Thou art

Dear desire of every nation
Joy of every longing heart

Born thy people to deliver
Born a child and yet a King

Born to reign in us forever
Now Thy gracious Kingdom bring

By Thine own eternal Spirit
Rule in all our hearts alone

By Thine all-sufficient merit
Raise us to Thy glorious throne

​By Thine all-sufficient merit
Raise us to Thy glorious throne
