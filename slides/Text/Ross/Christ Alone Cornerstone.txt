Title: Christ Alone Cornerstone.pro

Christ Alone
Cornerstone

My hope is built
On nothing less

Than Jesus’ blood
And righteousness

I dare not trust
The sweetest frame

But wholly trust
In Jesus’ name

Christ alone cornerstone
Weak made strong

In the Savior’s love
Through the storm

He is Lord
Lord of all

When darkness seems
To hide His face

I rest on His
Unchanging grace

In every high and
Stormy gale

My anchor holds
Within the veil

Christ alone cornerstone
Weak made strong

In the Savior’s love
Through the storm

He is Lord
Lord of all

When he shall come
With trumpet sound

Oh may I then in
Him be found

Dressed in His
Righteousness alone

Faultless stand
Before the throne

Christ alone cornerstone
Weak made strong

In the Savior’s love
Through the storm

He is Lord
Lord of all

Christ alone cornerstone
Weak made strong

In the Savior’s love
Through the storm

He is Lord
Lord of all
