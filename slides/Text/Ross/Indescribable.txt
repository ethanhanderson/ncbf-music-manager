Indescribable

From the highest of heights
To the depths of the sea

Creation’s revealing
Your majesty

From the colors of fall
To the fragrance of spring

Every creature unique
In the song that it sings

All exclaiming
Indescribable uncontainable

You placed the stars in the sky
And You know them by name

You are amazing God
All powerful untamable

Awestruck we fall to our knees
As we humbly proclaim

You are amazing God

Who has told every lightning bolt
Where it should go?

Or seen heavenly storehouses
Laden with snow

Who imagined the sun and
Gives source to its light?

Yet conceals it to bring
Us the coolness of night

None can fathom
Indescribable uncontainable

You placed the stars in the sky
And You know them by name

You are amazing God
All powerful untamable

Awestruck we fall to our knees
As we humbly proclaim

You are amazing God
Indescribable uncontainable

You placed the stars in the sky
And You know them by name

You are amazing God
Incomparable unchangeable

You see the depths of my heart
And You love me the same

You are amazing GodYou are amazing God
