Title: This Is My Father's World.pro

This Is My
Father’s World

This is my Father's world
And to my listening ears

All nature sings and round me rings
The music of the spheres

This is my Father's world 
I rest me in the though

Of rocks and trees
Of skies and seas

His hand the wonders wrought
This is my Father's world

The birds their carols raise
The morning light the lily white

Declare their maker's praise
This is my Father's world

He shines in all that's fair
In the rustling grass

I hear Him pass
He speaks to me everywhere

This is my Father's world
Oh let me never forge

That though the wrong 
Seems oft so strong

God is the ruler yet
This is my Father's world

The battle is not done!
Jesus who died shall be satisfied

And earth and
Heaven be one
