Title: Because He Lives.pro

Because He Lives

I believe in the Son
I believe in the risen one

I believe I overcome
By the power of His blood

Amen amen

I’m alive I’m alive
Because He lives

Amen amen

Let my song join the
One that never ends

Because He lives

I was dead
In the grave

I was covered in
Sin and shame

I heard mercy
Call my name

He rolled the
Stone away

Amen amen

I’m alive I’m alive
Because He lives

Amen amen

Let my song join the
One that never ends

Because He lives
I can face tomorrow

Because He lives
Every fear is gone

I know He holds my life
My future in his hands

Amen amen

I’m alive I’m alive
Because He lives

Amen amen

Let my song join the
One that never ends

Amen amen

I’m alive I’m alive
Because He lives

Amen amen

Let my song join the
One that never ends

Because He lives
Because He lives
