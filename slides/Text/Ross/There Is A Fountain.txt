There Is A Fountain

There is a fountain filled with blood Drawn from Immanuel’s veins

And sinners plunged beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains

Lose all their guilty stains 
Lose all their guilty stains

And sinners plunged beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains

The dying thief rejoiced to see
That fountain on his day

And there have I though vile as he
Washed all my sins away

Washed all my sins away
Washed all my sins away

And there have I though vile as he
Washed all my sins away

Dear dying lamb thy precious blood
Shall never lose its power

Till all the ransomed church of God
Be saved to sin no more

Be saved to sin no more
Be saved to sin no more

Till all the ransomed church of God
Be saved to sin no more

Ever since by faith I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply

Redeeming love has been my theme
And shall be till I die

And shall be till I die
And shall be till I die

Redeeming love has been my theme
And shall be till I die

When this poor lisping stammering tongue
Lies silent in the grave

Then in a nobler sweeter song
I’ll sing Thy power to save

I’ll sing Thy power to save
I’ll sing Thy power to save

Then in a nobler sweeter song
I’ll sing Thy power to save
