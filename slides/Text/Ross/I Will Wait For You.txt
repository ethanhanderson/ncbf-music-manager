I Will Wait For You

Out of the depths I cry to You
In darkest places I will call

Incline Your ear to me anew
And out of the depths I cry to You

Were You to count my sinful ways
How could I come before Your throne

Yet full forgiveness meets my gaze
I stand redeemed by grace alone

I will wait for You I will wait for You
On Your word I will rely

And I will wait for You 
Surely wait for You
Till my soul is satisfied

So put Your hope in God alone
Take courage in His power to save

Completely and forever won
By Christ emerging from the grave

I will wait for You I will wait for You
On Your word I will rely

I will wait for You surely wait for You
Till my soul is satisfied

Now He has come to make a way
And God Himself has paid the price

That all who trust in Him today
Find healing in His sacrifice

That all who trust in Him today
Find healing in His sacrifice

I will wait for You
I will wait for You

Through the storm and
Through the night

I will wait for You surely wait for You
For your love is my delight
