Title: Go Tell It On The Mountian.pro

Go Tell It On
The Mountain

Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere

Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born

While shepherds kept their watching
Over silent flocks by night

Behold throughout the
Heavens there shone a holy light

Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere

Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born

The shepherds feared and 
Trembled when lo above the earth

Rang out the angel chorus that
Hailed our savior’s birth

Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere

Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born

Down in a lowly manger the
Humble Christ was born

And brought us God’s salvation
That blessed Christmas morn!

Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere

Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born

Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere

Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born

Yes Jesus Christ
Is born
