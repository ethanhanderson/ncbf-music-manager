How Great
Thou Art

Oh Lord my God
When I in awesome wonder

Consider all the worlds 
Thy hands have made

I see the stars
I hear the rolling thunder

Thy power throughout 
The universe displayed

Then sings my soul
My Savior God to Thee

How great Thou art
How great Thou art!

Then sings my soul 
My savior God to Thee

How great Thou art 
How great Thou art!

And when I think that God
His son not sparing

Sent Him to die
I scarce can take it in

That on the cross, 
My burden gladly bearing

He bled and died 
To take away my sin

Then sings my soul
My savior God to Thee

How great Thou art
How great Thou art!

Then sings my soul
My savior God to Thee

How great Thou art
How great Thou art!

When Christ shall come 
With shout of acclamation

And take me home
What joy shall fill my heart!

Then I shall bow
In humble adoration

And there proclaim
My God how great Thou art!

Then sings my soul
My savior God to Thee

How great Thou art, 
How great Thou art!

Then sings my soul
My savior God to Thee

How great Thou art, 
How great Thou art!
