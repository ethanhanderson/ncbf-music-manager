Christ our Wisdom

Christ our wisdom we are humbled 
When You hide your ways from us

You have purposes unnumbered 
Each one good and glorious

Help us trust when we grow weary
Free us from our anxious thoughts

Give us grace to see more clearly
You are God and we are not

Christ our wisdom be our gladness
When we fail to understand

You ordain all joy and sadness 
To fulfill Your perfect plan

Help us know You rule with power 
Over every raging flood

In our most uncertain hour
You are God and we are loved.

Christ our wisdom we will follow
Though the way ahead is veiled

As we journey through the shadows 
Grant us faith where sight has failed

Help us cling to Your commandments
Strengthened by Your faithful Word

We will never be abandoned
You are God and we are yours

Christ our wisdom we adore You
For the beauty of the cross

Once in foolishness we scorned You
But your blood has ransomed us

Help us sing the endless mercies
Of Your humble heart to save

Christ our wisdom Christ our glory
You are God forever praised

Help us sing the endless mercies
Of Your humble heart to save

Christ our wisdom Christ our glory
You are God forever praised
