Title: May The Mind Of Christ My Savior.pro

May The Mind Of
Christ My Savior

May the mind of Christ my savior
Live in me from day to day

By His love and power controlling
All I do and say

May the word of God dwell richly
In my heart from hour to hour

So that all may see I triumph
Only through His power

May the peace of God my Father
Rule my life in everything

That I may be calm to comfort
The Sick and sorrowing

May the love of Jesus fill me
As the waters fill the sea

Him exalting self abasing
This is victory

May I run the race before me
Strong and brave to face the foe

Looking only unto Jesus
As I onward go

May His beauty rest upon me
As I seek the lost to win

And may they forget the channel
Seeing only Him
