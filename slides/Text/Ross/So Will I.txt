Title: So Will I.pro

So Will I

God of creation

There at the start before
The beginning of time

With no point of reference

You spoke to the dark and flesh
Out the wonder of light

And as you speak

A hundred billion
Galaxies are born

In the vapor of your breath
The planets form

If the stars were made
To worship so will I

I can see your heart in
Everything you’ve made

Every burning star
A signal fire of grace

If creation sings your
Praises so will I

God of your promise
You don’t speak in vain

No syllable empty or void
For once you have spoken

All nature and science follow
The sound of your voice

And as you speak

A hundred billion creatures
Catch your breath

Evolving in pursuit
Of what you said

If it all reveals your
Nature so will I

I can see your heart in
Everything you say

Every painted sky
A canvas of your grace

If creation still
Obeys you so will I

If stars were made to
Worship so will I

If the mountains bow in
Reverence so will I

If the oceans roar your
Greatness so will I

For if everything exists to
Lift you high so will I

If the wind goes where
You send it so will I

If the rocks cry out 
In silence so will I

If the sum of all our
Praises still falls shy

Then we’ll sing again a
Hundred billion times

God of salvation

You chased down my heart through
All of my failure and pride

On a hill you created

The light of the world abandoned
In darkness to die

And as you speak

A hundred billion
Failures disappear

Where you lost your life
So I could find it here

If you left the grave 
Behind You so will I

I can see your heart in
Everything you’ve done

Every part designed in a 
Work of art called love

If you gladly chose
Surrender so will I

I can see your heart
Eight billion different ways

Every precious one
A child you died to save

If you gave your life to
Love them so will I

Like you would again
A hundred billion times

But what measure could
Amount to your desire

You’re the one who never
Leaves the one behind
