Oceans

You call me out
Upon the waters

The great unknown
Where feet may fail

And there I find
You in the mystery

In oceans deep
My faith will stand

And I will call
Upon Your name

And keep my eyes
Above the waves

When oceans rise

My soul will rest
In your embrace

For I am yours
And you are mine

Your grace abounds
In deepest waters

Your sovereign hand
Will be my guide

Where feet may fail
And fear surrounds me

You’ve never failed
And you won’t start now

So I will call
Upon your name

And keep my eyes
Above the waves

When oceans rise

My soul will rest
In your embrace

For I am yours
And you are mine

Spirit lead me where my
Trust is without borders

Let me walk
Upon the waters

Wherever you
Would call me

Take me deeper than my 
Feet could ever wander

And my faith will
Be made stronger

In the presence
Of my Savior

Spirit lead me where my 
Trust is without borders

Let me walk
upon the waters

Wherever you
Would call me

Take me deeper than my 
Feet could ever wander

And my faith will
Be made stronger

In the presence
Of my Savior

So I will call
Upon your name

Keep my eyes
Above the waves

When oceans rise

My soul will rest
In your embrace

I am yours and
You are mine
