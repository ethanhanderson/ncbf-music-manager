Title: Lord I Need You.pro

Lord I Need You

Lord I come
I confess

Bowing here
I find my rest

Without You
I fall apart

You’re the One
That guides my Heart

Lord I need You
Oh I need You

Every hour
I need You

My one defense
My righteousness

Oh God how
I need You

When sin runs deep
Your grace is more

Where grace is found
Is where You are

And where you are
Lord I am free

Holiness is
Christ in me

Lord I need You
Oh I need You

Every hour
I need You

My one defense
My righteousness

Oh God how
I need You

Teach my song
To rise to You

When temptation
Comes my way

And when I cannot
Stand I’ll fall on You

Jesus You’re my
Hope and stay

Lord I need You
Oh I need You

Every hour
I need You

My one defense
My righteousness

Oh God how
I need You

My one defense
My righteousness

Oh God how
I need You

You’re my one defense
My righteousness

Oh God how
I need You
