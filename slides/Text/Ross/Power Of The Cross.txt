Power Of
The Cross

Oh to see the dawn
Of the darkest day

Christ on the
Road to Calvary

Tried by sinful men
Torn and beaten then

Nailed to a
Cross of wood

This the power
Of the cross

Christ became
Sin for us

Took the blame
Bore the wrath

We stand forgiven
At the cross

Oh to see the painWritten on Your face

Bearing the awesome
Weight of sin

Every bitter thought
Every evil deed

Crowning Your
Bloodstained brow

Now the daylight flees
Now the ground beneath

Quakes as its maker
Bows His head

Curtain torn in two
Dead are raised to life

Finished the victory cry

Oh to see my name
Written in the wounds

For through Your
Suffering I am free

Death is crushed to death
Life is mine to live

Won through Your selfless love

This the power of the cross
Son of God slain for us

What a love what a cost!
We stand forgiven at the cross
