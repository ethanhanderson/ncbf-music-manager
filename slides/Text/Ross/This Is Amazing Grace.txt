This Is Amazing Grace

Who breaks the power
Of sin and darkness

Who's love is mighty 
And so much stronger

The king of glory
The king above all kings

Who shakes the whole earth 
With holy thunder

Who leaves us breathless 
In awe and wonder

The king of glory
The king above all kings

This is amazing grace
This is unfailing love

That You would take my place
That you would bear my cross

You would lay down your life
That I would be set free

Oh Jesus I sing for
All that you've done for me

Who brings our chaos
Back into order

Who makes the orphan 
A son and daughter

The king of glory
The king above all kings

Who rules the nations 
With truth and justice

Shines like the sun 
In all of it's brilliance

The king of glory
The king above all kings

This is amazing grace
This is unfailing love

That You would take my place
That you would bear my cross

You would lay down your life
That I would be set free

Oh Jesus I sing for
All that you've done for me

Worthy is the Lamb
Who was slain

Worthy is the King 
Who conquered the grave

Worthy is the Lamb
Who was slain

Worthy is the King 
Who conquered the grave

Worthy is the Lamb
Who was slain

Worthy is the King 
Who conquered the grave

Worthy is the Lamb
Who was slain

Worthy is the King 
Who conquered the grave

This is amazing grace
This is unfailing love

That You would take my place
That you would bear my cross

You would lay down your life
That I would be set free

Oh Jesus I sing for
All that you've done for me

Oh Jesus I sing for
All that you've done for me
