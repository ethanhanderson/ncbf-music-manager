Title: The Wonderful Cross.pro

The Wonderful Cross

When I survey 
The wonderful cross

On which the Prince
Of glory died

My richest gain
I count but loss

And pour contempt
On all my pride

See from His head
His hands His feet

Sorrow and love
Flow mingled down

Did ever such love
And sorrow meet

Or thorns compose
So rich a crown

Oh the wonderful cross
Oh the wonderful cross

Bids me come and die
And find that I may truly live

Oh the wonderful cross
Oh the wonderful cross

All who gather here
By grace draw near

And praise your name

Where the whole realm
Of nature mine

That were an offering
Far too small

Love so amazing
So divine

Demands my soul
My life my all

Oh the wonderful cross
Oh the wonderful cross

Bids me come and die
And find that I may truly live

Oh the wonderful cross
Oh the wonderful cross

All who gather here
By grace draw near

And praise your name
