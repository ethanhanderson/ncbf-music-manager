Title: It It Well With My Soul.pro

It Is Well
With My Soul

When peace like a river
Attendeth my way

When sorrows like
Sea billows roll

Whatever my lot Thou hast
Taught me to say

It is well it is well
With my soul

It is well it is well
With my soul with my soul

It is well
It is well with my soul!

Though Satan should buffet
Though trials should come

Let this blessed
Assurance control

That Christ has regarded
My helpless estate

And hath shed his own
Blood for my soul!

It is well it is well
With my soul with my soul

It is well
It is well with my soul!

My Sin oh the bliss of
This glorious thought

My sin not in part
But the whole

Is nailed to the cross
And I bear it no more

Praise the Lord
Praise the Lord oh my soul

It is well it is well
With my soul with my soul

It is well
It is well with my soul!

And Lord haste the day when
My faith shall be sight

The clouds be rolled
Back as a scroll

The trump shall resound and
The Lord shall descend

Even so it is well
With my soul!

It is well it is well
With my soul with my soul

It is well
It is well with my soul!

It is well it is well
With my soul with my soul

It is well
It is well with my soul!
