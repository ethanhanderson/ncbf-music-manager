Title: Alas And Did My Savior Bleed.pro

Alas And Did My
Savior Bleed

Alas and did my savior bleed
And did my sovereign die?

Would He devote that sacred head
For such a worm as I!

Was it for crimes that I had done
He groaned upon the tree?

A mazing pity grace unknown!
And love beyond degree!

Well might the sun in darkness hide 
And shut his glories in

When Christ the mighty Maker died
For man the creature’s sin

Thus might I hide my blushing face
While His dear cross appears

Dissolve my heart in thankfulness
And melt my eyes to tears

But drops of grief can never repay
The debt of love I owe

Here Lord I give myself away
Tis all that I can do
