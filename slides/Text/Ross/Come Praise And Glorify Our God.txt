Title: Come Praise And glorify Our God

Come Praise And
Glorify Our God

Come praise and glorify our God
The Father of our Lord

In Christ He has in heavenly realms
His blessings on us poured

For pure and blameless in His sight
He destined us to be

And now we’ve been adopted
 Through His son eternally

To the praise of Your glory
To the praise of Your mercy and grace

To the praise of Your glory
You are the God who saves

Come praise and glorify our God
Who gives His grace in Christ

In Him our sins are washed away
Redeemed through sacrifice

In him God has made known to us
The mystery of His will

That Christ should be the head of all
His purpose to fulfill

Come praise and glorify our God
For we’ve believed the word

And through our faith we have a seal
The Spirit of the Lord

The Spirit guarantees our hope
Until redemption’s done

Until we join in endless praise
To God the three in One
