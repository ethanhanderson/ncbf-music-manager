Title: Tis So Sweet To Trust In Jesus.pro

Tis So Sweet To
Trust In Jesus

Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus
And to take him at his word

Just to rest upon his promise
And to know thus saith the Lord

Jesus Jesus how I trust him
How I’ve proved him o’er and o’er

Jesus Jesus precious Jesus
Oh for grace to trust him more

Oh how sweet to trust in Jesus
Just to trust his cleansing blood

And in simple faith to plunge me 
‘Neath the healing cleansing flood

Yes tis sweet to trust in Jesus
Just from sin and self to cease

Just from Jesus simply taking
Life and rest and joy and peace

I’m so glad you died to save me
Precious Jesus Savior friend

And I know that thou art with me
Wilt be with me to the end

Jesus Jesus precious Jesus
Oh for grace to trust him more
