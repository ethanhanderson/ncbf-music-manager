Title: The First Noel.pro

The First Noel

The first noel the
Angel did say

Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay

In fields where they lay
Keeping their sheep

On a cold winters night
That was so deep

Born is the
King of Israel

They looked up and
Saw a star

Shining in the East
Beyond them far

And to the earth it
Gave good light

And so it continued
Both day and night

Born is the
King of Israel

And by the light of
That same star

Three wise men came
From country far

To seek for a king
Was their intent

And to follow the star
Wherever it went

Born is the
King of Israel

This star drew nigh
To the northwest

Over Bethlehem it
Took its rest

And there it did
Stop and stay

Right over the place
Where Jesus lay

Born is the
King of Israel

Then let us all
In one accord

Sing praises to our
Heavenly Lord

That hath made heaven
And earth of nought

And with His blood
Mankind has bought

Born is the
