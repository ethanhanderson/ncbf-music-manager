Oh For a Thousand Tongues to Sing

Oh for a thousand tongues to sing
My great Redeemer’s praise

The glories of my God and King
The triumphs of His grace

My gracious Master and my God 
Assist me to proclaim

To spread through all the earth abroad 
The honors of Thy name

Jesus! The name that charms our fears
That bids our sorrows cease

‘Tis music in the sinner’s ear
‘Tis life and health and peace

He breaks the power of canceled sin
He sets the prisoner free

His blood can make the foulest clean 
His blood availed for me

He speaks and listening to His voice
New life the dead receive

The mournful broken hearts rejoice
The humble poor believe

Glory to God and praise and love
Be ever ever given

By saints below and saints above
The church in earth and heaven
