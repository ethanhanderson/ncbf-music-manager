Title: Away In A Manger.pro

Away In A Manger

Away in a mangerNo crib for His bed

The little lord JesusLay down His sweet head

The stars in the skyLook down where He lay

The little lord JesusAsleep on the hay

The cattle are lowingThe poor baby wakes

But little lord JesusNo crying He makes

I love Thee lord JesusLook down from the sky

And stay by my sideTill morning is nigh

Be near me lord JesusI ask Thee to stay

Close by me foreverAnd love me I pray

Bless all the dear childrenIn Thy tender care

And take us to HeavenTo live with Thee there
