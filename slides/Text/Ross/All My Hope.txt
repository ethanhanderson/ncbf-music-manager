All My Hope

I’ve been held by the savior
I’ve felt fire from above

I’ve been down to the river
I ain’t the same a prodigal returned

All my hope is in JesusThank God that yesterday's gone

All my sins are forgivenI've been washed by the blood

I'm no stranger to the prisonI've worn shackles and chains

But I've been freed and forgivenAnd I'm not going back

I'll never be the same
That's why I sing

All my hope is in Jesus
Thank God my yesterday's gone

All my sins are forgiven
I've been washed by the blood

All my hope is in Jesus
Thank God my yesterday's gone

All my sins are forgiven
I've been washed by the blood
