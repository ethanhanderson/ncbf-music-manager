Title: Come Thou Fount.pro

Come Thou Fount

Come thou fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing thy praise

Streams of mercy never ceasing 
Call for songs of loudest praise

Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above

Praise the mount I’m fixed upon it
Mount of Thy redeeming love

Here I raise my Ebenezer
Hither by Thy help I come

And I hope by Thy good measure 
Safely to arrive at home

Jesus sought me when a stranger
Wandering from the fold of God

He to rescue me from danger
Interposed His precious blood

Oh to grace how great a debtor
Daily I’m constrained to be

Let Thy goodness like a fetter
Bind my wandering heart to Thee

Prone to wander Lord I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love

Here’s my heart Lord take a seal it
Seal it for Thy courts above
