Title: How Marvelous.pro

How Marvelous

I stand amazed in the presence
Of Jesus the Nazarene

And wonder how He could love me
A sinner condemned unclean

How marvelous how wonderful
And my song shall ever be

How marvelous how wonderful
Is my Savior’s love for me

He took my sins and my sorrows
He made them His very own

He bore the burden to Calvary
And suffered and died alone

When with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see

It will be my joy through the ages
To sing of His love for me
