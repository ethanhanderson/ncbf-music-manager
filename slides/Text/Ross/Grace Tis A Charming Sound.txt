Grace Tis A
Charming Sound

Grace tis a charming sound
Harmonious to the ear

Heaven with the echo shall resound
And all the earth shall hear

Saved by grace alone!
This is all my plea

Jesus died for those he saved
And Jesus died for me

Twas grace that wrote my name
In life’s eternal book

Twas grace that gave me to the Lamb
Who all my sorrows took

Saved by grace alone!
This is all my plea

Jesus died for those he saved
And Jesus died for me

Grace taught my wandering feet
To tread the heavenly road

And new supplies each hour I meet
While pressing on to God

Saved by grace alone!
This is all my plea

Jesus died for those he saved
And Jesus died for me

Grace taught my soul to pray
And made mine eyes overflow

Twas grace which kept me to this day
And will not let me go

Saved by grace alone!
This is all my plea

Jesus died for those he saved
And Jesus died for me

Oh let Thy grace inspire
My soul with strength divine

May all my powers to Thee aspire
And all my days be Thine

Saved by grace alone!
This is all my plea

Jesus died for those he saved
And Jesus died for me
