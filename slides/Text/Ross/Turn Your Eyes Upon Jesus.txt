Title: Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus.pro

Turn Your Eyes
Upon Jesus

Oh soul you are weary
And troubled

No light in the
Darkness you see

There’s light for a
look at the Savior

And life more
Abundant and free

Through death into
Life everlasting

He passed and we
Follow Him there

Over us sin no more
 Hath dominion

For more than
Conquerors we are

Turn your eyes
Upon Jesus

Look full in His
Wonderful face

And the things
Of earth

Will grow
Strangely dim

In the light of His
Glory and grace

His word shall not fail you
He promised

Believe Him and
All will be well

Then go to a world
That is dying

His perfect 
Salvation to tell
