Hark The Herald
Angels Sing

Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn king

Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled!

Joyful all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies

With the angelic hosts proclaim
Christ is born in Bethlehem!

Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King

Christ by highest heaven adored
Christ the everlasting Lord

Late in time behold him come
Offspring of the virgin's womb

Veiled in flesh the Godhead see
Hail the incarnate deity

Pleased with us in flesh to dwell
Jesus our Immanuel

Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn king

Hail the heaven born prince of peace!
Hail the son of righteousness!

Light and life to all he brings
Risen with healing in his wings

Mild he lays his glory by
Born that we no more may die

Born to raise us from the earth
Born to give us second birth

Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King
