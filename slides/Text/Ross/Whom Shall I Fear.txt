Title: Whom Shall I Fear.pro

Whom Shall I Fear

You hear me when I call
You are my morning song

Though darkness
Fills the night

It cannot hide the light
Whom shall I fear?

You crush the enemy
Underneath my feet

You are my sword
And shield

Though troubles linger still
Whom shall I fear?

I know who goes before me
I know who stands behind

The God of angel armies
Is always by my side

The One who reigns forever
He is a friend of mine

The God of angel armies
Is always by my side

My strength is in your name
For You alone can save

You have delivered me
Yours is the victory!

Whom shall I fear?
Whom shall I fear?

I know who goes before me
I know who stands behind

The God of angel armies 
Is always by my side

The One who reigns forever
He is a friend of mine

The God of angel armies
Is always by my side

And nothing formed against
Me shall stand!

You hold the whole
World in your hands

I'm holding on to
Your promises

You are faithful
You are faithful!

And nothing formed against
Me shall stand!

You hold the whole
World in your hands

I'm holding on to
Your promises

You are faithful 
You are faithful

You are faithful!

I know who goes before me
I know who stands behind

The God of angel armies 
Is always by my side

The One who reigns forever
He is a friend of mine

The God of angel armies
Is always by my side

I know who goes before me
I know who stands behind

The God of angel armies
Is always by my side

The One who reigns forever
He is a friend of mine

The God of angel armies
Is always by my side

The God of angel armies
Is always by my side
