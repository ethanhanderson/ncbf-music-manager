Title: The Lord Is My Salvation.pro

The Lord Is
My Salvation

The grace of God has reached for me
And pulled me from a raging sea

And I am safe on this solid ground
The Lord is my salvation

I will not fear when
Darkness falls

His strength will help
Me scale these walls

I’ll see the dawn of the rising sun
The Lord is my salvation

Who is like the Lord our God
Strong to save faithful in love

My debt is paid and the victory won
The Lord is my salvation

My hope is hidden in the Lord
He flowers each promise of His word

When winter fades
I know spring will come

The Lord is my salvation

In times of waiting times of need
When I know loss when I am weak

I know His grace will
Renew these days

The Lord is my salvation

And when I reach my final day
He will not leave me in the grave

But I will rise He will call me home
The Lord is my salvation

My debt is paid and the victory won
The Lord is my salvation
