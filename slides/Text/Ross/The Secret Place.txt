The Secret Place

Who dwells within
His most secret place

Is never far from
His blessed grace

Neath His great shadow
All will be well

No better place now
For us to dwell

The secret place of
God most high

The shadow of
Our mighty King

The dwelling place
Where angels cry

Is where our praise
Will forever ring

Is where our praise
Will forever ring

Fear not the terror that
Comes at night

Nor flaming arrows by
Morning light

His truth is always our
Sword and shield

Against His power all
Foes must yield

A thousand fall now
At every side

Ten thousand more may
Have yet to die

Yet plague and sword can
Never kill the soul

His angels guard us now
Safe and whole

Refuge and fortress
For all who trust

No safer pasture
For men of dust

Neath wings and feathers
Of Holy Lord

No greater comfort
Can He afford
