Thy Mercy

Thy Mercy My God 
Is the theme of my song

The joy of my Heart and
The boast of my tongue

Thy free grace alone
From the first to the last

Hath won my affection
And bound my soul fast

Without thy sweet mercy
I could not live here

Sin would reduce me
To utter dispair

But through thy free goodness
My spirit’s revived

And he that first made me
Still keeps me alive

Thy mercy is more than
A match for my heart

Which wonders to feel
Its own hardness depart

Dissolved by thy goodness
I fall to the ground

And weep for the praise
Of the mercy I’ve found

Great Father of mercies
Thy goodness I own

And the covenant love
Of thy crucified son

All praise to the spirit
Whose whisper divine

Seals mercy and pardon
And righteousness mine

All praise to the spirit
Whose whisper divine

Seals mercy and pardon
And righteousness mine
