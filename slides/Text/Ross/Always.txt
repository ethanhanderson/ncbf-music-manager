Always

My foes are many
They rise against me

But I will hold
My ground

I will not fear the war
I will not fear the storm

My help is on the way
My help is on the way

Oh my God
He will not delay

My refuge and
Strength always

I will not fear
His promise is true

My God will come through
Always always

Trouble surrounding
Chaos abounding

My soul will
Rest in you

I will not fear the war
I will not fear the storm

My help is on the way
My help is on the way

Oh my God
He will not delay

My refuge and
Strength always

I will not fear
His promise is true

My God will come through
Always always

I lift my eyes up
My help comes from the Lord

My help comes from the Lord
My help comes from the Lord

My help comes from the Lord
My help comes from the Lord

Oh my God
He will not delay

My refuge and
Strength always

I will not fear
His promise is true

My God will come through
Always always

I will not fear
His promise is true

My God will come through
Always always
