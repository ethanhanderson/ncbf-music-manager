Title: Jesus Thank You.pro

Jesus Thank You

The mystery of the cross
I cannot comprehend

The agonies of Calvary

You the perfect Holy One
Crushed Your son

Who drank the bitter cup
Reserved for me

Your blood has
washed away my sin

Jesus
Thank You

The Father’s wrath
Completely satisfied

Jesus
Thank You

Once Your enemy
Now seated at Your table

Jesus
Thank You

By Your perfect sacrifice
I’ve been brought near

Your enemy you’ve
Made your friend

Pouring out the riches
Of Your glorious grace

Your mercy and Your
Kindness know no end

Lover of my soul
I want to live for You
