Come Behold The
Wonderous Mystery

Come behold the wondrous mystery 
In the dawning of the king

He the theme of heavens praises
Robed in frail humanity

In our longing in our darkness 
Now the light of life has come

Look to Christ who condescended
Took on flesh to ransom us

See the true and better Adam
Come to save the hell bound man

Christ the great and sure fulfillment
Of the law in Him we stand

Come behold the wondrous mystery 
Christ the Lord upon the tree

In the stead of ruined sinners
Hangs the Lamb in victory

See the price of our redemption
See the Father’s plan unfold

Bringing many sons to glory
Grace unmeasured love untold

Come behold the wondrous mystery
Slain by death the God of life

But no grave could ever restrain him
Praise the Lord He is alive!

What a foretaste of deliverance
How unwavering our hope

Christ in power resurrected
As we will be when he comes

What a foretaste of deliverance
How unwavering our hope

Christ in power resurrected
As we will be when he comes
