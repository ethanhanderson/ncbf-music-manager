Overwhlemed

I see the works
Of Your hands

Galaxies spin in a
Heavenly dance oh God

All that You are 
Is so overwhelming

I know the power
Of Your cross

Forgiven and free forever
You'll be my God

And all that You've done
Is so overwhelming

I delight myself in You
Captivated by Your beauty

I'm overwhelmed
I'm overwhelmed by You

God I run into Your arms
Unashamed because of mercy

I'm overwhelmed
I'm overwhelmed by You

I see the works of
Your hands

Galaxies spin in a
Heavenly dance oh God

All that You are is
So overwhelming

I know the power
Of Your cross

Forgiven and free forever
You'll be my God

And all that You've done
Is so overwhelming

I delight myself in You
Captivated by Your beauty

I'm overwhelmed
I'm overwhelmed by You

God I run into Your arms
Unashamed because of mercy

I'm overwhelmed
I'm overwhelmed by You

You are beautiful
You are beautiful

Oh God there is no
One more beautiful

You are beautiful
God You are the most beautiful

You are glorious
You are glorious

Oh God there is no
One more glorious

You are glorious
God you are the most glorious

I delight myself in You
Captivated by Your beauty

I'm overwhelmed
I'm overwhelmed by You

I delight myself in You
Captivated by Your beauty

I'm overwhelmed
I'm overwhelmed by You

I'm overwhelmed
I'm overwhelmed by You

God I run into Your arms
Unashamed because of mercy

I'm overwhelmed
I'm overwhelmed by You
