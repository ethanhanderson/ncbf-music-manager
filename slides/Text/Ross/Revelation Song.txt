Revelation Song

Worthy is the
Lamb who was slain

Holy Holy
Is He

Sing a new song
To Him who sits on

Heaven’s
Mercy seat

Holy holy holy
Is the Lord God Almighty

Who was and is
And is to come

With all creation
I sing

Praise to the
King of Kings

You are my everything
And I will adore you

Clothed in rainbows
Of living color

Flashes of lightning
Rolls of thunder

Blessing and honor strength and
Glory and power be

To you the
Only wise King

Holy holy holy 
Is the Lord God Almighty

Who was and is
And is to come

With all creation
I sing

Praise to the
King of Kings

You are my everything
And I will adore you

Filled with wonder
Awestruck wonder

At the mention
Of your name

Jesus your name
Is power

Breath and
Living water

Such a
Marvelous mystery

Holy holy holy
Is the Lord God Almighty

Who was and is
And is to come

With all creation
I sing

Praise to the
King of Kings

You are my everything
And I will adore you

Holy holy holy
Is the Lord God Almighty

Who was and is
And is to come
