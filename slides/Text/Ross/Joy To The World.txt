Joy To The World

Joy to the world the Lord has come
Let earth receive her King

Let every heart
Prepare Him room

And heaven and nature singAnd heaven and nature sing

And heaven and heaven
And nature sing

Joy to the earth the Savior reigns
Let men their songs employ

While fields and floods
Rocks hills and plains

Repeat the sounding joyRepeat the sounding joy

Repeat repeat the
Sounding joy

He rules the world with truth and grace
And makes the nations prove

The glories of
His righteousness

And wonders of His loveAnd wonders of His love

And wonders
Wonders of His love
