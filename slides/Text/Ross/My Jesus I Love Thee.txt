Title: My Jesus I Love Thee.pro

My Jesus I
Love Thee

My Jesus I love Thee 
I know Thou art mine

For Thee all the follies 
Of sin I resign

My Gracious Redeemer
My Savior art Thou

If ever I loved Thee
My Jesus tis now

I love Thee because 
Thou hast first loved me

And purchased my pardon
On Calvary's tree

I love Thee for wearing
The thorns on Thy brow

If ever I loved Thee
My Jesus tis now

I'll love Thee in life 
I will love Thee in death

I'll praise Thee as long
As Thou lendest me breath

And say when the death
Dew lies cold on my brow

If ever I loved Thee
My Jesus tis now

In mansions of glory
And endless delight

I'll ever adore Thee 
In Heaven so bright

And sing with the glittering 
Crown on my brow

If ever I loved Thee
My Jesus tis now

If ever I loved Thee
My Jesus tis now
