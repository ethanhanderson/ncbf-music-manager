In Christ Alone

In Christ alone
My hope is found

He is my light
My strength my song

This cornerstone
This solid ground

Firm through the fiercest
Drought and storm

What heights of love
What depths of peace

Where fears are still
When strivings cease

My comforter
My all in all

Here in the love of
Christ I stand

In Christ alone
Who took on flesh

Fullness of God
In helpless Babe

This gift of love
And righteousness

Scorned by the ones
He came to save

Till on that cross
As Jesus died

The wrath of God
Was satisfied

For every sin on
Him was laid

Here in the death of
Christ I live

There in the ground
His body lay

Light of the world
By darkness slain

Then bursting forth
In glorious day

Up from the grave
He rose again

And as He stands
In victory

Sin’s curse has lost
Its grip on me

For I am His
And He is mine

Bought with the precious
Blood of Christ

No guilt in life
No fear in death

This is the power 
Of Christ in me

From life’s first cry
To final breath

Jesus commands
My destiny

No power of hell
No scheme of man

Can ever pluck
Me from His hand

Till He returns
Or calls me home

Here in the power
Of Christ I’ll stand
