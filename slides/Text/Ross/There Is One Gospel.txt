There Is One Gospel

There is one Gospel on which I stand
For all eternity

It is my story my Father’s plan
The son has rescued me

Oh what a Gospel oh what a peace
My highest joy and my deepest need

Now and forever He is my light
I stand in Gospel of Jesus Christ

There is one Gospel to which I cling
All else I count as loss

For there where justice and mercy meet
He saved me on the cross

No more I boast in what I can bring
No more I carry the weight of sin

For He has brought me from
Death to life
I stand in Gospel of Jesus Christ

There is one Gospel where
Hope is found
The empty tomb still speaks

For death could keep my Savior down 
He lives and I am free

Now on my Savior I fix my eyes
My life is His and His hope is mine

For He has promised I too will rise
I stand in the Gospel of Jesus Christ

And in this Gospel the Church is one
We do not walk alone

We have His Spirit as we press on
To lead us safely home

And when in Glory still I will sing
Of this old story that rescued me

Praise to my Savior the King of life
I stand in the Gospel of Jesus Christ

And when in Glory still I will sing
Of this old story that rescued me

Praise to my Savior the King of life
I stand in the Gospel of Jesus Christ

Praise to my Savior the King of Life
I stand in the Gospel of Jesus Christ

I stand in the Gospel of Jesus Christ
