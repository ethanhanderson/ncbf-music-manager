His Mercy Is More

Praise the lord
His mercy is more

Stronger than darkness
New every morn

Our sins they are many
His mercy is more

What love could remember
No wrongs we have done

Omniscient all knowing
He counts not their sum

Thrown into a sea without
Bottom or shore

Our sins they are many
His mercy is more

What patience would wait
As we constantly roam

What father so tender
Is calling us home

He welcomes the weakest
The vilest the poor

Our sins they are many
His mercy is more

What riches of kindness
He lavished on us

His blood was the payment
His life was the cost

We stood neath a debt
We could never afford

Our sins they are many
His mercy is more

Our sins they are many
His mercy is more

Our sins they are many
His mercy is more
