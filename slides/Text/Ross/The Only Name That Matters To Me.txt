Title: The Only Name That Matters To Me.pro

The Only Name 
That Matters To Me

Yours will be
The only name that matters to me

The only One who’s favor I seek
The only name that matters to me

Yours will be
The friendship and affection I need

To feel my Father smiling on me
The only Name that matters to me

And yours is the name
The name that has saved me

Mercy and grace
The power that forgave me

And your Love is
All I’ve ever needed

Yours will be
The only name that matters to me

The only One who’s favor I seek
The only name that matters to me

And yours is the name
The name that has saved me

Mercy and grace
The power that forgave me

And your Love is all
I’ve ever needed

When I wake up in the land of glory
With the saints I will tell my story

There will be one Name
That I proclaim

When I wake up in the land of glory
With the saints I will tell my story

There will be one Name
That I proclaim

Jesus Jesus
Jesus is just that Name
