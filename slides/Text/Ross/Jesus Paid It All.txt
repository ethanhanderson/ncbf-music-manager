Jesus Paid It All

I hear the Savior say
Thy strength indeed is small

Child of weakness
Watch and pray

Find in Me
Thine all in all

Jesus paid it all
All to Him I owe

Sin had left a
Crimson stain

He washed it
White as snow

Lord now indeed I find thy
Power and thine alone

Can change the leper's spots
And melt the heart of stone

Jesus paid it all
All to Him I owe

Sin had left a
Crimson stain

He washed it
White as snow

And when before the throne
I stand in him complete

Jesus died my soul to save
My lips shall still repeat

Jesus paid it all
All to Him I owe

Sin had left a
Crimson stain

He washed it
White as snow

He washed it
White as snow
